was closely related to the structural phase transition from the
high-temperature 1T’-phase to the low-temperature Td-phase
according to the consistent thermal hystereses of Raman spectra
and electrical resistivity. Therefore, the thermal hysteresis of
thermal conductivity here is dominated by the phonon transpor-
tations. This phonon manipulation in metastable MoTe makes it

RESULTS
In general, the crystal structures of MoTe can be described as
