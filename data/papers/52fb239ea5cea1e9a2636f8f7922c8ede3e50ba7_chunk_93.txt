could get the task done just by using the sympy and the datetime libraries. We
also ask annotators to report any bugs in answer annotation, which they report
for a small number of questions; we subsequently fix those.

20 dollars per hour up to 20 hours per week as compensation for the data
annotation work.
L¯ila-Robust To create the L¯ila-Robust dataset, we first define a set of 9
templates, consisting of 3 variation styles defined in SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021)
as well as 6 novel templates of our own. We refer to the SVAMP templates as
SVAMP-COO,SVAMP-COP,andSVAMP-IU,whichcorrespondtochangingthe
order of objects, changing the order of phrases, and adding irrelevant, unhelpful
information to the problem statement, respectively. Our novel templates are
