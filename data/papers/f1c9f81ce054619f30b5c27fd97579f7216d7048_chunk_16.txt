robustness for long-term tracking through uncertainty reduction using random
erasing,robustrandomsearchwithspatio-temporalconstraints,andbackground
augmentation for more discriminative feature learning. Quantitative and quali-
tative evaluation on the VOT-LT2020 benchmark dataset demonstrates the su-
periority of our method over the state-of-the-art long-term trackers.
