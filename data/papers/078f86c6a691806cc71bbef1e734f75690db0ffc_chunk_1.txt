Abstract
Although Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Seg-
mentation has shown impressive improvement in recent
years,thefairnessconcernsinthedomainadaptationhave
yettobewelldefinedandaddressed.Inaddition,fairnessis
oneofthemostcriticalaspectswhendeployingthesegmen-
tation models into human-related real-world applications,
e.g., autonomous driving, as any unfair predictions could
influence human safety. In this paper, we propose a novel
Fairness Domain Adaptation (FREDOM) approach to se-
manticscenesegmentation.Inparticular,fromtheproposed
formulatedfairnessobjective,anewadaptationframework
willbeintroducedbasedonthefairtreatmentofclassdistri-
butions. Moreover,togenerallymodelthecontextofstruc-
turaldependency,anewconditionalstructuralconstraintis
introduced to impose the consistency of predicted segmen-
tation. Thanks to the proposed Conditional Structure Net-
work,theself-attentionmechanismhassufficientlymodeled
thestructuralinformationofsegmentation.Throughtheab-
lation studies, the proposed method has shown the perfor-
mance improvement of the segmentation models and pro-
motedfairnessinthemodelpredictions. Theexperimental
resultsonthetwostandardbenchmarks, i.e., SYNTHIA→
Cityscapes and GTA5 → Cityscapes, have shown that our
methodachievedState-of-the-Art(SOTA)performance1.
