that it referred to did exist. Upon the completion of the co-coding exercise, the authors
discussed all disagreement cases with both coders to ascertain the consistency in the
interpretation of the coding scheme before the comprehensive implementation of the coding
exercise. Table 4 shows the inter-rater reliability results.

3.5 Statistical analyses
With regards to the examination of differences between the types of intertextuality (RQ1a-b),
sources of reference (RQ2), and intertextuality manifested in different moves (RQ3), a two-
tailed t-test and one-way ANOVA were conducted to determine whether any significant
differences were found between leader messages from the US and PRC, and if so, what
variations were evident. In investigating whether there was an interaction between country and
intertextual types on sources of reference (RQ2), a two-way ANOVA was performed.

4.1 The types of intertextuality

The first set of research questions inquired into the types of intertextuality evident in leaders’
messages from global corporations in the US and PRC. The results showed that T3 (M=9.9706)
was the most frequently used type of intertextuality followed by T4 (M=6.8529), T2
(M=2.3235), T5 (M=1.6471), and T1 (M=0.5294) in messages from the PRC. Similarly, T3
(M=9.5366) was the most commonly used type of intertextuality followed by T4 (M=5.4878),
T5 (M=1.4634), T2 (M=0.2439) and T1 (M=0.1951) in messages from the US.
Notably, Chinese leaders’ messages (RQ1a) revealed a significant difference in intertextuality
types (F(4,165)= 10.899, p<0.0001). The Tukey post hoc test showed that the occurrence of
T3 was statistically significantly higher than T1 (p<0.0001), T2 (p<
