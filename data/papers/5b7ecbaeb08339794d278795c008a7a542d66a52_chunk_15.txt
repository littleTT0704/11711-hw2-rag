 reflects sincerity in interpersonal communication (Afifi,
2007). Empathy and remorse help build solidarity with the public through which a deeper
level of bonding can be achieved. Because a close personal relationship can contribute to
repairing a damaged relationship (Lewis et al., 2015), the apology is viewed as more
acceptable when relational outcomes are nurtured.

2) Maximizing Positive Effects
Strategies to reduce offensiveness—like bolstering—were more employed in the MPE
approach, aiming at emphasizing the company’s good image of prior self (Kiambi & Shafer,
2016). This strategy can be linguistically realized using positive appreciation, engagement,
and positive judgment. Consider example 4 below.
(4) The hard work [positive Judgment] of regaining the trust [positive Appreciation] of
the American people that was developed over the course of the company’s 118 year
history is ongoing and I know [Heterogloss] it must [Heterogloss] be sustained.
(Apology from Richard Smith, CEO of Equifax, 2017)
In example 4, the CEO, drawing on the positive appreciation “trust” and positive
judgment “hard work,” boasts about the company’s long-term diligence and willingness to
rectify the misdeed. In addition, the CEO employs the engagement “know” to seek common
ground with the public and indicate that the company shares the public’s expectations of an
excellent service standard while he uses “must” to emphasize his work commitment.
3) Neutralizing Negative Effects
In this approach, evading responsibility strategies (i.e., defeasibility) ascribe the crisis
situation to some external factors beyond the company’s control, which can be realized
through negative appreciation as illustrated by example 5.
(5) I wish we could have gotten the answers we needed sooner, but [Heterogloss] forensic
analysis is a very [Force] complex [negative Appreciation], time-consuming [negative
Appreciation] process. (Apology from Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony, 2011)

To neutralize the bad consequences induced by the crisis, the CEO uses the heterogloss
“but” alongside the negative appreciation “complex” and “time-consuming,” with the
boosted force “very�
