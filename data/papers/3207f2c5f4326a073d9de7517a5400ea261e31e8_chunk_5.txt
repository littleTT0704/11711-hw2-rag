BI series of compounds or identify the target through photo- Amide Hydrolysis and Genotoxicity
cross-linking experiments was unsuccessful, and so it remains
unknown if the target of these compounds is glycoprotein B,
another viral protein or a host cell protein.
The compounds featured in Table 2 all have an embedded
1,4-diaminobenzene core capped on each nitrogen atom with
an acyl group. If either of these amides were subject to
hydrolysis in vivo, the resulting electron rich aniline could

a risk of genotoxicity.10 In view of this consideration, HLM-
metabolite identification experiments were conducted to
establish if either amide bond was generally predisposed to
metabolic hydrolysis. The results clearly indicated that the N1
amide bond was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding aniline.
