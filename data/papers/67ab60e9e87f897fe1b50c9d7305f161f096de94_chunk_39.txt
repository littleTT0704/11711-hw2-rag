we treat this as a classification, not regression problem.

from DCASE 2016 Task 2 (Mesaros et al., 2018). Novel, insofar as our evaluation uses

Postprocessing: Predictions were postprocessed using 250 ms median filtering. At each
validation step, a minimum event duration of 125 or 250ms was chosen to maximize onset-
only event-based F-measure (with 200ms tolerance). Scores werecomputed using sed eval
(Mesaros et al., 2016).
Beehive States Thisisabinaryclassification taskusingaudiorecordingsoftwo beehives
(Nolasco et al., 2019). The beehives are in one of two states: a normal state, and one in
which the queen beeis missing(“queen-less”). At 10 minutes long, this task has the longest
audio clips in HEAR.
Beijing Opera Percussion This is a novel audio classification task developed using the
Beijing Opera Percussion Instrument Dataset (Tian et al., 2014). The Beijing Opera uses
six main percussion instruments that can be classified into four main categories: Bangu,
Naobo, Daluo, and Xiaoluo.
CREMA-D CREMA-D is a dataset for emotion recognition (Cao et al., 2014). The

emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral and sad). For HEAR, we only use the audio
recordings (which differs from much but not all of the literature).
ESC-50 This is a multiclass classification task on environmental sounds. The ESC-50
dataset is a collection of 2000 environmental sounds organized into 50 classes (Piczak,
2015). Scores are averaged over 5 folds. (The folds are predefined in the original dataset.)
FSD50K FSD50K is a multilabel task (Fonseca et al., 2020). This dataset contains over
100 hours of human-labeled sound events from Freesound (https://freesound.org/).
