Table 7.4: Candidate recall of Watson on Jeopardy! and TREC questions when using
sources that were expanded with web search results and a locally stored web crawl.
For each setup, we show the percentage gain and the number of questions gained/lost
when comparing the results to the sources without expansion. All improvements are
significant with p <.01 based on a one-sided sign test.
In Table 7.5 we report Watsonâ€™s QA accuracy for the same combinations of infor-
mation sources and datasets. Again an additional performance gain is realized when
Wikipedia is expanded with text nuggets extracted from ClueWeb09 on top of using
all other manually acquired and automatically compiled sources. The improvement
is small on the regular Jeopardy! dataset because the performance bar is already
very high, but much larger for Final Jeopardy! and TREC questions. The evalua-
tion results are unbiased since the answer patterns were manually augmented with
additional correct answers returned by Watson in first place in any of these exper-
iments. In Section 6.4.2 we have seen that search-based source expansion improves
precision@70 on regular Jeopardy! questions from 84.12% to 87.74% when using the
large collection of manually acquired sources as the baseline. The extraction-based
approach, when applied only to Wikipedia, further improves this metric to 88.68%.
This means that if Watson chooses to answer a regular Jeopardy! question, it will be
right almost 9 out of 10 times.
The experimental results confirm that the statistical relevance model deployed
in the SE system can select relevant information from a very large and noisy text
corpus without pre-filtering the content using a retrieval system. Our method works
equally well when applied directly to a locally stored corpus, and thus its effectiveness
is not explained by the use of a web search engine. In practice, the choice between
