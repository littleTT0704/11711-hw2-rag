0.0001), and T5 (p<0.0001).
Also, the occurrence of T4 was statistically significantly higher than T1 (p<0.002) and T5
(p<0.019). (See Figure 1a) Similar results were seen in the intertextual types identified in the
US leadersâ€™ messages (RQ1a). A significant difference was found in the use of different types
of intertextuality (F(4,200)= 17.358, p<0.0001). The Tukey post hoc test revealed that T3 was
statistically significantly higher than T1 (p<0.0001), T2 (p<0.0001), T4 (p<0.03) and T5
(p<0.0001). Also, the use of T4 was statistically significantly higher than T1 (p<0.002), T2
(p<0.002), T3 (p<0.03) and T5 (p<0.032). (See Figure 1b) The findings show that leader
messages from Global 500 corporations in the US and PRC are highly intertextual and fairly
uniform, manifesting different types of intertextuality consistent with Bazerman (2004),
making most use of the types of intertextuality which refer to another text without direct
quotation or mentioning a person/company (T3), and using recognisable phrasing associated
with particular documents (T4).

In examining the differences between the types of intertextuality found in the messages of
leaders from corporations in the PRC and US (RQ1b), the use of T1 (M =0.5294, M =0.1951,
CN US
p=0.05) and T2 (M =2.3235, M =0.2439, p=0.0003) was statistically significantly higher
CN US
in messages from corporations in the PRC as opposed to their US counterparts.

The second research question investigated the sources of intertextuality in leadersâ€™ messages
from corporations in the US and PRC. Our findings indicated that R1 was the most frequently
used source of reference (M=10.44
