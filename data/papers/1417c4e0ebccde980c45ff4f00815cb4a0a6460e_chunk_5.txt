Figure 2: The unadjusted weekly spread of Covid-19 cases (top) generally outpaces the weekly spread
adjusted for expanded testing (bottom). In some cases, such as NV, the adjusted spread could imply a
larger problem than is obvious from the unadjusted increase in positive test counts.
States Most at Risk for an Increase in Incidence Are Not Always the Same as
States with the Most Positive Cases
Fig. 2 shows the weekly increase in positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (top) alongside the weekly change in our
estimate of daily incidence (bottom). To calculate the corrected daily incidence, we compute Eq. 9 for each
day. Forboththeuncorrectedandthecorrectedincidences, wereportthepercentagechangefromthe7-day
average ending on June 29, 2020 to the 7-day average ending on July 6, 2020. These results show that the
majority of states have uncorrected levels of SARS-CoV-2 spread which are larger than the changes in the
estimated incidence after correcting for increased testing.
In addition, the ranking of the states most at risk for increased SARS-CoV-2 spread changes after
correcting for increased testing. The 5 states with largest percentage increase in positive test counts were
MT, ID, WV, DE, and AK, while the 5 states with largest increase in our estimate were NV, VT, SC, MS,
and WA.
We also examine the relationship between population density and the weekly change in the estimated
incidence
