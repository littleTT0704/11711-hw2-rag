Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed an unprecedented challenge to governments worldwide. Effective
government communication of COVID-19 information with the public is of crucial importance.
Objective: We investigate how the most-read state-owned newspaper in China, People’s Daily, used an online social networking
site, Sina Weibo, to communicate about COVID-19 and whether this could engage the public. The objective of this study is to
develop an integrated framework to examine the content, message style, and interactive features of COVID-19–related posts and
determine their effects on public engagement in the largest social media network in China.
Methods: Content analysis was employed to scrutinize 608 COVID-19 posts, and coding was performed on three main dimensions:
content, message style, and interactive features. The content dimension was coded into six subdimensions: action, new evidence,
reassurance, disease prevention, health care services, and uncertainty, and the style dimension was coded into the subdimensions
of narrative and nonnarrative. As for interactive features, they were coded into links to external sources,
