 in the cross-validations.
We then performed pairwise comparisons of the strategies based on the differences in
average precision on each of the 12 topics.2
In Table 5.5 we show p-values for both sentence-level text nuggets and markup-
based nuggets. In each test, we assumed that the ranking strategy at the left-hand
side performs at least as well as the strategy at the top. The null hypothesis is that
the strategies are equally effective at ranking nuggets, and the alternative is that the
strategy to the left is more effective. It can be seen that almost all improvements are
statistically significant at the 1% level. The only exception is the difference between
LR Adjacent and LR Independent on markup nuggets, which is only significant at
the 5% level (p = 0.0134). The smallest possible p-value in these significance tests is
2.44e-4, which indicates that one method outperformed the other on all 12 topics.
When interpreting these results, one should keep in mind that the outcome of
the tests depends on the performance metric used to determine which rankings are
better and to quantify the difference in the quality of two rankings. We used average
