 state level (95% CI
1.32-16.13; P=.02), a correlation that remained significant when adjusting for state Medicaid expansion (P=.02) or use of a
state-based marketplace (P=.03).
Conclusions: This correlation indicates Twitter’s potential as a real-time monitoring strategy for future marketplace enrollment
periods; marketplaces could systematically track Twitter sentiment to more rapidly identify enrollment changes and potentially
emerging issues. As a repository of free and accessible consumer-generated opinions, this study reveals a novel role for Twitter
in the health policy landscape.
