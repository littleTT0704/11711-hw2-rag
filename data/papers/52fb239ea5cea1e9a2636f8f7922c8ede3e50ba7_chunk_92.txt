B.1 Expert annotation
In the worker qualification process, we ask each worker to annotate 30 questions.
WemanuallyverifyeachannotationandqualifythosewhosePythonannotations
are satisfactory. We also provide feedback such as "write simpler programs, use
representative variable names instead of just letters, add comments wherever
possible" to annotators after the worker qualification process. We instruct
