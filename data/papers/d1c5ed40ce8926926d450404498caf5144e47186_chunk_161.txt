Table 7.5: QA accuracy of Watson on Jeopardy! and TREC questions when using
sources that were expanded with web search results and a locally stored web crawl.
For each setup, we show the percentage gain and the number of questions gained/lost
when comparing the results to the sources without expansion. All improvements are
significant with p <.01 based on a one-sided sign test.
search-based and extraction-based source expansion should be made based on the
knowledge domain and the available information sources. For instance, web searches
may be unavoidable if up-to-date information is required (such as recent news) or if
theresimplyexistsnolocalcorpusforagivendomain. Conversely,localsourcescanbe
the only choice if the QA domain involves confidential data or specialized knowledge
that is not available on the Web. We have also seen that the two SE approaches can
complement one another, and that additional improvements in search performance
and end-to-end QA results can be attained if these methods are combined.
7.2 Expansion of Unstructured Sources
In this thesis, we applied the statistical source expansion approach to seed corpora in
which each document is about a distinct topic that is specified and disambiguated by
its title. Topic-
