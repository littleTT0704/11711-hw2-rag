programming styles.
5 Results and Analysis
A summary of all key results on our L¯ila benchmark are shown in Table 3. In
thissection, we willdiscuss theperformanceoffine-tuned 2.7BGPT-Neo models
(§5.1), performance of models along the 4 categories of tasks (§5.2) and finally,
the few-shot performance of much larger ( 175B parameters) models (§5.3).

5.1 Results: Fine-tuned Models
Multitasking improves IID performance, robustness, and OOD gener-
alization. The multi-tasking model (Bha¯skara) substantially improves upon
the single task models (Neo). Bha¯skara achieves better average in-domain
performance than the 23 individual per-task models (0.480 vs. 0.394 average
score), suggesting that it leverages cross-task structure not present in a single
task’s training set.
We also find that our multi-task model is robust to the linguistic perturba-
tions we test in L¯ila-Robust. We did not find any degradation in performance
when testing on perturbed IID test examples. Additionally, multi-task training
substantially improves out
