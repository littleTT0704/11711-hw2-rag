240–260K in the hysteretic properties of thermal and electrical

structural hysteresis was also observed in a high-resolution XRD
study,16 indicating the two phases can coexist in a wider
temperature range than that shown in the transport property. A
possible explanation might be that a higher activation energy is
needed to overcome the potential barrier to enable the phase
transition. We have experimentally verified that this hysteretic
behavioris repeatableand consistent in multiple samples.
