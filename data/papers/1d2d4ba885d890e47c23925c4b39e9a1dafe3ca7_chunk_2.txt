 Segars & Kohut, 2001). Horton (1995)
defines corporate leader messages as “instruments” (p.180) concerned with communicating
business objectives and achieving corporate success. Specifically, they are defined as
communication from top management (i.e. CEOs, chairmen, managing directors, presidents,
etc.) and include information about corporate values, strategy, vision, mission and pertinent
information about the corporation with an aim of enhancing the image of the corporation and
building relationships with stakeholders (AUTHOR, 2014; Bhatia, 2008; Hamm, 2006;
Kitchen & Schultz, 2001; Kong, 2001). These messages comprise a genre in itself (AUTHOR,
2017) and its audience include capital market stakeholders (i.e. shareholders), product market
stakeholders (i.e. suppliers and customers), and corporate stakeholders (i.e. managers and
employees) (Hitt, Ireland, & Hoskisson, 2005). Research has shown that corporate leader
messages play an important role in image-building and relationship-building with various
stakeholder groups (Bhatia, 2010; AUTHOR, 2015; 2017) while also serving as a strategic
communication tool (Zorn, 2001).
Corporate leader messages have attracted some attention in business communication studies
(e.g. AUTHOR, 2014; 2015; Hyland, 1998), focusing on aspects such as the textual

characteristics, communication styles and use of metadiscourse. Such messages, however, are
relatively underexplored in the applied linguistics, especially (ESP) literature. Among the few
studies documented is Bhatia’s (2008) analysis of the Chairman’s letter/message to
shareholders in the annual report, noting that this PR discourse served the purposes of building
confidence in stakeholders about the prospects of the corporation and promoting the image of
the corporation. He also identified seven moves in these letters. In more recent studies,
AUTHOR (2017) examined the move structure of leader messages employed to build
relationships with stakeholders in Fortune Global 500 US and PRC corporations, with the
findings indicating that these messages demonstrated cross-cultural variations in that
corporations from the US used only 5 moves whereas those from the PRC used 6 moves.
Despite the work done, one phenomenon which is widely known to be characteristic of
corporation communication is
