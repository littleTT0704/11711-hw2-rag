Another motivation for hyperspherical FR comes from the FR can be divided into additive margin [3], [4], [5] and
observation that deep features are intrinsically discrimina- multiplicative margin [1], [2]. As a representative multiplica-
tive margin method, SphereFace renders promising geo-
metric insights. However, in contrast to additive margin,
