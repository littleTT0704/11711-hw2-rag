In terms of a spatial constraint, the score is more penalized when the distance
between new and old positions is large. This distance penalty term prevents
the problem of abnormal detection at a long distance. Meanwhile, this distance
penaltyiscompensatedbythetimepenalty(i.e.atemporalconstraint),astime
passes by not finding the target. This is because, if the period during which the

3.4 Background Augmentation for More Discriminative Feature
Learning
In the short-term baseline tracker, we extract features and trains the model by
applying some transforms (blur, rotate, horizontal flip) in the searching area of
the target. To train a robust model against the background clutter, we try to
augment various backgrounds that are not included in the search area by com-
biningthetargetimagewithanotherbackground.Thisaugmentationskillmakes

Learning at the first frame. The bounding box is given in the first frame,
which means that the target image is completely confident. Therefore, we train
the short-term tracker using new data augmentation and additionally store the
newly generated images in the memory system. This approach allows for im-
proved discriminative learning in the first frame.
