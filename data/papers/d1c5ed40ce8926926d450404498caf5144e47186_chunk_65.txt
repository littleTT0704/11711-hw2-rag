 weighted with its idf score, which is estimated
from the same sample of Wikipedia articles used for the TopicRatioSeed feature,
and weights are normalized to sum to 1. This feature takes into account that
nuggets containing query terms that describe the topic are more likely to be
topical, and that more weight should be given to rare terms.
• 3rdPersonPronoun (binary, per nugget):
Whether the text nugget contains a third person pronoun, which may refer to
the topic and thus increases the likelihood of the nugget being topical.
Search features:
• DocumentRank (discrete, per document):
Retrieval rank of the document the text nugget was extracted from. Documents
that are ranked high by the search engine usually contain more relevant text.
• SearchAbstractCoverage (continuous, per nugget):
Fraction of the tokens in the abstract generated by the web search engine for the
source document of a text nugget that are covered in the nugget. The abstract
is the search engine’s view of the most relevant text. Nuggets that overlap with
the abstract often closely match the query and are more likely to be relevant.
Surface features:
• KnownTokenRatio (continuous, per nugget):
Fraction of the tokens in the text nugget that occur in a large corpus of English
text comprising web pages, encyclopedias, dictionaries, newswire corpora and
literature. English text nuggets usually contain many known words.
• Known3GramRatio (continuous, per nugget):
Fraction of the token 3-grams in the text nugget that occur in the same English
text corpus. This feature is similar to KnownTokenRatio, but the tokens must
also appear in proper English word order.
• Avg3GramCount (continuous, per nugget):
Average frequency of the token 3-grams in the English text corpus. This feature
is similar to Known3GramRatio but favors nuggets with 3-grams that are more
frequently used in English.
• NuggetLength (discrete, per nugget):
Length of the text nugget measured in tokens. Very short nuggets are usually
not relevant.
