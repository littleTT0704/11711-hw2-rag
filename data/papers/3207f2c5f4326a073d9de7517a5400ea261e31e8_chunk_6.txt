wide variety of aliphatic replacements for the central aromatic

FacedwiththerealitythattheN-arylamidecoreofthisseries

of the N1 amide were established empirically using the HLM
assay. In short, the metabolic stability for a wide range of
compounds was compared in the presence and absence of the
cytochrome P450 cofactor NADPH (a full description can be
found in the Supporting Information). Compounds were
grouped based on the dependence of metabolic stability on
the presence of NADPH in the assay conditions. Structural
features common to the compounds that depended on
NADPH for metabolic clearance were then prioritized for
future optimization. From this analysis, two general trends
emerged.First,thenatureofthefive-memberedheteroaromatic

compounds 1 and 3, respectively, were completely resistant to
hydrolysis, while both the thiazole and thiadiazole found in
compounds 2 or 4, respectively, were particularly prone to
hydrolysis. Unfortunately, aligning potency with ADME
properties favorably for the furan or oxazole containing
compounds was not possible, and so a path forward based on
