 seed,
the SE system retrieves related documents from an external source (retrieval stage in
Figure 4.1). We used the Web as a source of related information for the experiments
reportedin thisthesis. Theretrieveddocuments aresplitinto paragraph- orsentence-
length text nuggets (extraction stage), and their relevance with regard to the topic of
the seed is estimated using a statistical model (scoring stage). Finally, a new pseudo-
document is compiled from the most relevant nuggets (merging stage). Note that this
expansion is performed as a separate pre-processing step, and the expanded sources
can then be used in conjunction with the seed corpora by a QA system and other
information retrieval or extraction applications.
In Sections 4.1–4.4 we describe each of the pipeline stages in more detail, and
in Section 4.5 we give examples of generated pseudo-documents that illustrate how
source expansion improves question answering performance. A generalization of this
topic-oriented source expansion approach to unstructured seed corpora is discussed
in Chapter 7.
