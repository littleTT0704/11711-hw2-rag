grained picture
of the influence of different inflectional features, we have tested six different sets,
where each set includes the previous one and adds some more features. The fol-
lowing list describes each set in relation to the previous one:
1. No inflectional features at all
2. Case and possessive inflectional features for nominals
3. Set 2 + person/numberagreement inflectional features for nominals and verbs
4. Set 3 + all inflectional features for nominals
5. Set 4 + all inflectional features for verbs
6. Set 5 + all inflectional features

7 Lexicalization
Throughout the previous sections, we have seen that lexicalized models consis-
tently give higher parsing accuracy than unlexicalized models. In order to get a
more fine-grained view of the role of lexicalization, we have first studied the ef-
fect of lexicalizing IGs from individual part-of-speech categories and then from
different combinations of them (see figure 3).6 The results show that only the
individual lexicalization of nouns and conjunctions provides a statistically signifi-
cantimprovementin AS L and AS U, comparedto the totally unlexicalizedmodel.
Lexicalization of verbs also gives a noticeable increase in the labeled accuracy
even though it is not statistically significant. A further investigation on the mi-
