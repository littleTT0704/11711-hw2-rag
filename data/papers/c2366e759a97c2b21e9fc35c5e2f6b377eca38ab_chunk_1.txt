Abstract: Every home is different, and every person likes things done in their
particular way. Therefore, home robots of the future need to both reason about
thesequentialnatureofday-to-daytasksandgeneralizetouserâ€™spreferences. To
thisend,weproposeaTransformerTaskPlanner(TTP)thatlearnshigh-levelac-
tions from demonstrations by leveraging object attribute-based representations.
TTP can be pre-trained on multiple preferences and shows generalization to un-
seen preferences using a single demonstration as a prompt in a simulated dish-
washer loading task. Further, we demonstrate real-world dish rearrangement
using TTP with a Franka Panda robotic arm, prompted using a single human
demonstration. Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/temporal_

Machine learning (ML) enables learning complex tasks without extensive expert intervention:
robotic navigation [1, 2, 3], in-hand manipulation [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and planning [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
