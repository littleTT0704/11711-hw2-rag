rithms[113,64,114,65]andgraphneuralnetworkbasedSSLalgorithms[7,115,116,117,118]
in USB, which are also important to the SSL community. Moreover, it is of great importance to

of-distribution generalization [121], as well as time series anaysis [122]. We plan to evolve the

8 Conclusion
We constructed USB, a unified SSL benchmark for classification that aims to enable consistent

domains, introducing diverse tasks from multiple domains is still necessary in the SSL scenario
