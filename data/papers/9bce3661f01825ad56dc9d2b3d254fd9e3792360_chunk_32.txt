A ExamplesofHuman-SystemDiscussion
Here we examine whether humans and systems
canengageineffectivediscussionsbylookingat
actualdiscussions. Table8showstwoexamplesof
discussions with humans in each of the few-shot
andfew-shot-discussion. Thefirstisthatbothfew-
shot and few-shot-discussion can accept human
opinions and change their labels. However, the
discussionsdifferfromeachother. Infew-shot,the
system is not concerned with the content of the
premiseandhypothesis,butwiththedefinitionof
neutral and contradiction labels. In the few-shot-
discussion,thesystemcandiscusstherelationship

In the second case, both few-shot and few-
shot-discussionpredictthesamecontradictionla-
bel. Still, the discussion results differ in the
wrong acceptance and the correct refutation, re-
spectively. Thefew-shothasacceptedahuman’s
