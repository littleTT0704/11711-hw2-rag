How much does category encoding design matter? In our work, we represent category as the
extents of an objects’ bounding box. An alternative would be to denote the category as a discrete
setofcategoricallabels. Intuitively,boundingboxextentscapturesshapesimilaritybetweenobjects
and their placement implicitly, which discrete category labels do not. Fig. 13b shows that fourier

because such a vector encodes the fine and coarse nuances appropriately, which otherwise either
