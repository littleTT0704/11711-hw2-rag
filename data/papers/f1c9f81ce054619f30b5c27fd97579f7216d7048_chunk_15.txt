 in all cases. Especially in situations with visual characteristics of full-
occlusion, aspect ratio change, fast motion, and partial occlusion, our method
has an F-score performance of 0.05 or higher than the baseline.
Processing time analysis. In the LTB50 dataset, our method records 14.17
fps, which is somewhat lower than the object tracking speed of PrDiMP [11]
at 21.83 fps and DiMP [6] at 30.22 fps. All three proposed modules inevitably

that the random search method can improve the speed of about 3 fps compared
to the global sliding window method.

4.4 Qualitative Evaluation
Inthissection,weperformqualitativeevaluationbyselectingseveralsequences,
which are visualized in Fig 8. The total of 10 selected sequences is sorted based
on the number of times the target disappeared. Besides, not only the number of
timesdisappearedforeachsequence,butalsothenumberofframes,theduration
ofthetargetdisappearance,andthevisualattributesareorganizedinthefigure.
We show through various examples that our method RLT-DiMP estimates
a target position more accurately than SuperDiMP, PrDiMP [11], and DiMP
[6],withoutdependingontheabovesituations.Inparticular,weemphasizethat
our method has a robust re-detection ability with the aid of spatio-temporal
contraints in dog, bird1, boat, and person7 sequences where the target object
suddenly re-appears in a different location. In addition, we note that the target
is robustly tracked in carchase, warmup, uav1, and group2 sequences with sim-
ilar objects or background clutter through uncertainty reduction using random
erasing and enhanced discriminative feature learning with background augmen-
tation.
