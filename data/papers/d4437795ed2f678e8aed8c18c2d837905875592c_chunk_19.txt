Between the two technologies described above, there are a variety of intermediate general-
purpose and special-purpose computers, such as less expensive fine-grain image processing
boards and processors, that are suitable as experimental tools in research and in less time-critical
applications.
A research program on architectures for computer vision will involve three components:
basic technology, computer architecture, and software support.
At the basic technology level, research needs to be carried out on integrating existing as
well as emerging technologies in the design of real-time, small, inexpensive, and general-
purpose vision systems. Examples of these technologies include 3-D VLSI and/or photonics,
digital (and possibly analog) hybrid CMOS-CCD VLSI, application-specific DRAM (dynamic
random access memory) based processors, large hybrid substrate technology, and high-density
interconnect packages. Although some of these technologies may not be fully available today, it
is essential that design tools be developed to incorporate them in vision applications when they
become viable.
At the architecture level, there remain many issues to be resolved in order to integrate
heterogeneous peripheral preprocessing modules (such as optical processors, analog neural nets,
sensors with integrated analog preprocessing, and focal plane VLSI chips) with powerful parallel
processing systems. Immediate issues that need to be addressed include: a) development of a
consistent set of interfaces for connecting parallel processors into a heterogeneous ensemble; b)
development of a standard set of abstract machine models that can be mapped onto different
parallel hardware platforms; and c) research on heterogeneous parallel and distributed architec­
tures that permit different parallel systems to be tightly or loosely coupled in a flexible range of
configurations, where the processing element at each level can be matched to the varying com­
putational characteristics and data structures of vision algorithms. Tight coupling (i.e., high
bandwidth, low-latency communication, and coordinated control) is essential for parallel sys­
tems to work together efficiently; flexibility in configuring the system, on the other hand, is
necessary to address the requirements of different vision applications. Of particular interest is
the modularity and scalability of such architectures, especially the question of how different
components can be easily “glued” together,
