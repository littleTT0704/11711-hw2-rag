denotes the hypothesis with minimum error in the distributions specified with
D, but with no guarantees on the other distributions.
e.g., θ(cid:63)(D) can be “cats have chubby faces” when D specifies the distribution
to be picture book.
Further, θ(cid:63) denotes the classifier with minimum error on every distribution
considered. If the hypothesis space is large enough, θ(cid:63) should perform no worse
than θ(cid:63)(D) on distributions specified by D for any D.
e.g., θ(cid:63) is the true concept of “cat”, and it should predict no worse than “cats
have chubby faces” even when the distribution is picture book.

the RSC method. Finally, following conventions, we consider l(·,·) as the zero-
one loss and use a shorthand notation L(θ;D) = E l(h(z;θ),y)
(cid:104)z,y(cid:105)∼(cid:104)Z(D),Y(D)(cid:105)
for convenience, and we only consider the finite hypothesis class case within the
scope of this paper, which leads to the first formal result:
Corollary 1. If

where e(·;·) is a function defined as
e(z;θ(cid:63)):=E l(f(z;θ(cid:63));y)

and ξ(p) is a small number and a function of RSC’s hyperparameter p; z˜ is the
perturbed version of z generated by RSC, it is also a function of p, but we drop
the notation for
