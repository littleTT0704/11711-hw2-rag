Abstract
Health organizations advise social distancing, wearing face mask, and avoiding touching face to prevent the spread of
coronavirus.Basedontheseprotectivemeasures,wedevelopedacomputervisionsystemtohelppreventthetransmissionof
COVID-19.Specifically,thedevelopedsystemperformsfacemaskdetection,face-handinteractiondetection,andmeasures
social distance. To train and evaluate the developed system, we collected and annotated images that represent face mask
usage and face-hand interaction in the real world. Besides assessing the performance of the developed system on our own
datasets,wealsotesteditonexistingdatasetsintheliteraturewithoutperforminganyadaptationonthem.Inaddition,we
proposed a module to track social distance between people. Experimental results indicate that our datasets represent the
