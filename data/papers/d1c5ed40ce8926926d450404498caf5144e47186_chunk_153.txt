 active
learning techniques can be applied to fit a new relevance model without requiring
much annotated training data, and in Section 9.3 we propose a method for adapting
an existing model to a different source corpus or a new domain by combining active
learning with a transfer learning approach.
In Table 7.1 we show size statistics for the Wikipedia seed corpus and expansions
with increasing numbers of pseudo-documents generated from ClueWeb09 content.
The original 12 TB of redundant and very noisy web data were reduced to 500,000
documents about topics with high coverage in the crawl and a total size of 14.3 GB.

Table 7.1: Sizes of Wikipedia and expansions generated from a local web crawl.
In comparison, we selected 300,000 seed documents using popularity estimates and
generateda12.5GBcorpuswhenexpandingWikipediawithwebsearchresults. Thus
the expanded corpus that is based on the local web crawl is somewhat larger, but we
have seen that more data is not always helpful and can even hurt QA performance.
In the experiments with related content from Yahoo! results, Watsonâ€™s search recall
already started to decline on the TREC dataset when more than 200,000 seeds were
expanded (see Table 6.7 in Section 6.3.2).
It can be seen that the size of the expanded corpus increases almost linearly with
the number of seed documents. Since the length of the expanded pseudo-documents
is controlled by a threshold that is relative to the seed length, this means that seed
selection based on the estimated coverage in the web crawl only has a small bias
towards longer Wikipedia articles. In contrast, when selecting seeds using popularity
estimates, the first 100,000 pseudo-documents are much larger (5.8 GB) and the
size decreases quickly when seeds with lower popularity are expanded. Thus longer
Wikipedia articles are favored, which may improve relevance estimation performance
since some of the topicality features used in the statistical model benefit from more
seed content. However, additional related information about
