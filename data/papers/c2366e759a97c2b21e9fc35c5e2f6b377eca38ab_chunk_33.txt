a door and two sliding racks, an adjacent counter with a sink, and a “stage” with walls, floors,
and ceiling. We use selected objects from the ReplicaCAD [29] dataset, including seven types of
dishes(cups,glasses,trays,smallbowls,bigbowls,smallplates,bigplates)whichareloadedinto
the dishwasher. Fig. 11 shows a human demonstration recorded in simulation by pointing and
clicking on desired object to pick and place. We initialize every scene with an empty dishwasher
and random objects placed on the counter. Next, we generate dishwasher loading demonstrations,
adhering to a given preference, using an expert-designed data generation script. Expert actions
