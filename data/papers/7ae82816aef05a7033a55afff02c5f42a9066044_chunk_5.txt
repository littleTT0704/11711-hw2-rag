4 Experimental Setup
The Turkish Treebank [15], created by METU and SabancÄ± University, has been
used in the experiments. This treebank comprises 5635 sentences with gold stan-
dard morphological annotations and labeled dependencies between IGs. In the
treebank, 7.2% of the sentences contain at least one dependency relation that is
non-projective, not counting punctuation that is not connected to a head.4 Each
dependency link in the treebank starts from the final IG of the dependent word
and ends in some IG of the head word.
Since the parsing algorithm can only construct projective dependency struc-
tures, we only use projective sentences for training but evaluate our models on
the entire treebank.5 More precisely, we use ten-fold cross-validation, where we
randomly divide the treebank data into ten equal parts and in each iteration test
the parser on one part, using the projective sentences of the remaining nine parts
as training data.

to the immediately following word in order to eliminate this uninteresting source of
non-projectivity.Punctuation is also excluded in all evaluation scores.
5 Our trial to use the pseudo-projective parsing strategy of Nivre and Nilsson [14] in
order to process non-projective dependencies did not result in any improvement due
to thelimited amount of non-projective dependencies in the treebank.
The evaluation metrics used are the unlabeled (AS U) and labeled (AS L) at-
tachmentscore,i.e.,theproportionoftokensthatareattachedtothecorrecthead
(with the correct label for AS L). A correct attachment implies that a dependent
is not only attached to the correct head word but also to the correct IG within
theheadword.Whererelevant,wealsoreportthe (unlabeled)word-to-wordscore
