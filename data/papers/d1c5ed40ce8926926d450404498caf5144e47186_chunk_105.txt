 excluded. In Table 6.1 we give an overview of the
Jeopardy! datasets.
For each question that was revealed during a Jeopardy! game show, J! Archive
provides a correct answer that was given by one of the contestants or the host. These
answer keys were used to automatically evaluate search results and final answers
returned by Watson. Jeopardy! questions are usually designed to have only a single
correct answer, but this answer may change over time or there may be variations of
an answer string that would still be considered acceptable. In the DeepQA project at
IBM, human assessors who were not working on the QA system periodically updated
the original answers from J! Archive with additional correct answer strings found in
internal evaluations to more accurately estimate true system performance. We used
these extended answer keys in all our experiments.
6.1.2 TREC
The source expansion approach was also evaluated on factoid questions from the
TREC 8–15 evaluations, which are available on the NIST website2. The questions
were partitioned into a dataset consisting of independent factoid questions from
TREC 8–12 [Voorhees, 2003], and a dataset comprising series of questions about com-
montopicsfromTREC13–15[Dangetal.,2006]. Examplesofbothtypesofquestions
were given in Section 3.2.1. QA systems usually perform worse on the second dataset
because these questions are overall more difficult and can require more complex rea-
soning. In addition, the questions in TREC 13–15 often contain coreferences to their
topics, previous questions or answers. These coreferences can be difficult to resolve
accurately since not much context is provided. When evaluating the impact of our SE
method on Watson’s performance, we only used independent factoid questions from
TREC 8–12 because the system currently does not support TREC question series.
In experiments with OpenEphyra on TREC 13–15, we included the topic strings in
