However, if a text nugget contains a pronominal coreference it is also more likely to
be related to previous text, and thus a transition is less likely to occur.
8.2.2 Graphical Model
Let N,...,N be a sequence of text nuggets extracted from a document with labels

L,...,L âˆˆ {1 = relevant, 0 = irrelevant}, and let B,...,B be the boundaries be-

tween nuggets N and N, N and N, and so forth. If we make certain independence

assumptions about these random variables, we can use dynamic programming to es-
timate the probability that each text nugget is relevant given all text nuggets in the
same document. More precisely,
