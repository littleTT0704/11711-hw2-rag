Table 2: Summaryofthe19evaluationtasksofHEAR.Includestheembeddingtype(times-
tamp (T) or scene (S)), the predictor type (multiclass (C) or multilabel (L)), the
split method used during downstream evaluation (train/validation/test (TVT) or
K-fold), the duration of clips in seconds, the total number of clips for each task,
the primary evaluation metric, and whether or not the task is novel. Novel tasks
are notcomparable to theliterature. For all tasks except FSD50k, clips were stan-
dardized to one length using padding or trimming, typically the 95th percentile
length in the original corpus.
