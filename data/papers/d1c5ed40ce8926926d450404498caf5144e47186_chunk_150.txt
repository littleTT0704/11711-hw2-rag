7.1. EXTRACTION-BASED SOURCE EXPANSION 111
Many of the seeds with high coverage in the web crawl are about topics that are
relevant for Jeopardy! and TREC, but we also selected topics for which there may
already be an abundance of useful content in the information sources used for QA.
Other metrics for ranking seed documents may be more suitable for choosing topics
that are both relevant and helpful for questions that currently cannot be answered.
For example, one could compare the frequencies in an unstructured corpus to the
counts in the sources that are currently used by a QA system to identify topics that
are central to the given corpus but at the same time are not yet sufficiently covered in
the QA knowledge sources. We leave this as a possible direction for future research.
Content Extraction
For each selected seed document, text nuggets that mention its topic are extracted
from the unstructured corpus and are compiled into a large initial pseudo-document.
Similarly to the experiments with web search results, we extracted paragraph-length
nuggets delimited by structural HTML markup from ClueWeb09. Again, Wikipedia
redirects were taken into account as alternative surface forms of the same topic.
The highest-ranked topics were mentioned in millions of text nuggets throughout
the web crawl, and it was not feasible to store all these nuggets and estimate their
relevance using the statistical model due to space and runtime constraints. Therefore
we restricted the size of the pseudo-documents to 2 million characters for each topic.
