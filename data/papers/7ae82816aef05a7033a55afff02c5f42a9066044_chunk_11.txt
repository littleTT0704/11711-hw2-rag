±1.0), consists of the sentences only containing projective depen-
dencies with the heads residing on the right side of the dependents. We obtained
an AS U=78.3±0.3, AS L=68.9±0.2 and WW U=85.5±1.0 on the same dataset again
by using ten-fold cross-validation. Using the optimized model but omitting all
lexical features resulted in AS U=76.1±0.3, AS L=65.9±0.4 and WW U=82.8±1.2,
which shows that the improvement in accuracy cannot be attributed to lexical-
ization alone. The second subset is the Turkish dataset of the CoNLL-X Shared
Task on Multi-lingual Dependency Parsing [25]. We obtained an AS U=75.82 and
AS L=65.68 which are the best reported accuracies on this dataset.
9 Conclusion
Turkish is a language characterized by flexible constituent order and a very rich,
agglutinativemorphology.Inthispaper,wehaveshownthattheaccuracyachieved
in parsing Turkish with a deterministic data-driven parser can be improved sub-
stantially by using inflectional groups as tokens, and by making extensive use of
inflectional and lexical information in predicting the next parser action. Combin-
ingthesetechniquesleadstothehighestreportedaccuracyforparsingtheTurkish
Treebank.
However,besidesshowingthatmorpholexicalinformationmayimproveparsing
accuracy for languages with rich morphology and flexible word order, the exper-
iments also reveal that the impact of both morphological and lexical information
is not uniform across different linguistic categories. We believe that a more fine-
grained analysis of the kind initiated in this paper may also throw light upon the
apparently contradictory results reported in the literature, especially concerning
the value of lexicalization for different languages.
