 indicating an integrated use of crisis response
strategies in 34% of sentences (106 out of 315) of the apologies. Table 4 summarizes the use

crisis response strategies.
As seen in Table 4, attitude resources were the most preferred resource type. These

resources. Furthermore, negative affect (e.g., sorry) resources were salient in the mortification
strategy, together with the use of the intensified force (e.g., very).
