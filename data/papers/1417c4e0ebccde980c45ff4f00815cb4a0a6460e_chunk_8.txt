 provide a range of reasonable parameter values
and minimize our dependence upon an individual study. Second, our model does not project future spread,
such as could be done with a mechanistic model (e.g., SIR model; [1]). Third, our model uses test results,
which are dependent on both test availability and usage, as well as test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity,

SARS-CoV-2. First, weusedseveraltypesofepidemiologicstudies, aswellasseveralseroprevalencestudies,
to estimate the free parameter, thus minimizing reliance upon a single external study or type. Second,
this parameter can be re-estimated as results of new external studies become available. In particular,
representative seroprevalence studies in localities with reported test counts will improve the estimation of
the free parameter in our model. Third, our model has no other external inputs such as symptomatic rates
which are difficult to estimate for a novel virus. Fourth, our model can be applied repeatedly and at various
geographic levels to help inform public health decisions including re-opening of different localities.
