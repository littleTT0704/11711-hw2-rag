The MultiON dataset is created by syntheti-
cally adding objects in the Habitat-Matterport 3D
(HM3D)[152]scenes. Theobjectsareeithercylinder-
shapedornatural-looking(real)objects. Asshownin
Figure 6a, the cylinder objects are of the same height
and radius, with different colors. However, such ob-
jects do not appear realistic in the indoor scenes of
Matterport houses. Furthermore, detecting the same
objectwithdifferentcolorsmightbeeasyfortheagent
to learn. This has led us to include realistic-looking (b)
objectsthatcannaturallyoccurinhouses(Figure6b).
