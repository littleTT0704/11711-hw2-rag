. As shown in Fig. 3, in the earlier months of the epidemic there was a weak positive correlation
betweenpopulationdensityandtheweeklychangeinestimatedincidence.3 However,inthesummermonths,
we see that there is a negative correlation between these two features.
3State-level counts of positive and negative test results were not available before late March, so the initial outbreak of the
epidemicisnotcapturedinthesefigures.
