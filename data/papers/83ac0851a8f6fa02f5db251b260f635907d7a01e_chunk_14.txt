4.1.FixingYourMistakes
To investigate the degree to which models benefit from
backtracking, Figure 5 plots a modelâ€™s likelihood of suc-
cessfully completing the task after making its first mis-
take at each step. We use SMNA as our greedy baseline.
Our analysis finds that the previous SoTA model makes a
mistake at the very first action 40% of the time. Figure
5 shows the effect of this error: the greedy approach, if
madeamistakeatitsfirststep,hasa<30%chanceofsuc-
cessfully completing the task. In contrast, because FAST
detects its mistake, it returns to the starting position and
tries again. This simple one-step backtracking increases
