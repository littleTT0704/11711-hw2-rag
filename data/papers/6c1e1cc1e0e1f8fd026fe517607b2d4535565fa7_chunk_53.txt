 Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old
birthday. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001 and today is her 16-year-old
birthday, then today is 16 years later.
today = datetime(2001, 2, 28) + relativedelta(years=16)
# 24 hours later,
later = today + relativedelta(hours=24)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
later.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
