wide-coverage parsing and open-domain question answering, comprehension of
natural language discourse by humans and by machine, grammar-based language
modeling, natural languagegeneration,and the semantics of intonation in spoken
discourse. Much of his current NLP research addresses probabilistic parsing and
robust semantics for question answering using the CCG grammar formalism,
