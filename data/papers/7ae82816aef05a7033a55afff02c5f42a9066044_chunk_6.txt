We use the following set of features in all the experiments described below:
– POS of thetarget tokens
– POS of thetoken immediately below thetop token in the stack
– POS of thetoken immediately after thenext token in theremaining input
– POS of thetoken immediately after thetop token in the original input string
– DEP of theleftmost dependent of thetop token
– DEP of therightmost dependentof the top token
– DEP of theleftmost dependent of thenext token
This is an unlexicalized feature model, involving only POS and DEP features, but
we canget a lexicalizedversionby adding LEX features for the two targettokens.
The value of each LEX feature is the stem of the relevant word or IG, rather
than the full form. The reasoning behind this choice, which was corroborated in
preliminary experiments, is that since the morphological information carried by
thesuffixesisalsorepresentedintheinflectionalfeatures,usingthesteminsteadof
the wordform shouldnot cause any loss ofinformation andavoiddata sparseness
to a certain extent. The basic model, with and without lexicalization, is used as
the starting point for our experiments. Additional features are explained in the
respective subsections. An overview of the results can be found in table 1.
