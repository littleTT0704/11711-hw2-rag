ARS-CoV-2 infection. This model expands the set of methods and tools that public health officials can
use to assess epidemic spread. Decision-makers can consider these estimates of incidence to inform public
policy and avoid relying solely upon diagnostic test counts.
Methods
We have N individuals in the population. At each time t, we observe the following random variables:
• n (t), the number of individuals who test positive on day t
dp
• n (t), the number of individuals who tested positive up to and including day t
p
• n (t), the number of individuals who test negative on day t
dn
• n (t), the number of individuals who tested negative up to and including day t
n
In addition, we have the unobserved latent variables:
• zi(t), whether individual i has truly been infected
• ti(t), whether individual i has been tested
Finally, let T (t) denote the probability that an uninfected individual will be tested, and T (t) denote the
n p
probability that an infected individual will be tested, i.e. T (t)=P(ti(t)=1∣zi(t)=0), and T (t)=P(ti(t)=
n p
1∣zi(t)=1). We then define
T (t) P(ti(t)=1∣zi(t)=1)
c(t)= p = (1)
T (t) P(ti(t)=1∣zi(t)=0)
n
i.e. an infected individual is a factor of c(t) more likely to be tested than an uninfected individual.

Given all zi(t), the expected number of positive tests is
E (t)=E[n (t)∣z1(t),...,zN(t)]=Z(t)T (t), (2)

and the expected number of negative tests is
E (t)=E[n (t)∣z1(t),...,zN(t)]=(N −Z(t))T
