Abstract. We propose an improved discriminative model prediction
methodforrobustlong-termtrackingbasedonapre-trainedshort-term
tracker.Thebaselinepre-trainedshort-termtrackerisSuperDiMPwhich
combinesthebounding-boxregressorofPrDiMPwiththestandardDiMP
classifier. Our tracker RLT-DiMP improves SuperDiMP in the follow-
ing three aspects: (1) Uncertainty reduction using random erasing: To
make our model robust, we exploit an agreement from multiple im-
ages after erasing random small rectangular areas as a certainty. And
then, we correct the tracking state of our model accordingly. (2) Ran-
dom search with spatio-temporal constraints: we propose a robust ran-
dom search method with a score penalty applied to prevent the prob-
lemofsuddendetectionatadistance.(3)Backgroundaugmentationfor
more discriminative feature learning: We augment various backgrounds
that are not included in the search area to train a more robust model
in the background clutter. In experiments on the VOT-LT2020 bench-
markdataset,theproposedmethodachievescomparableperformanceto
the state-of-the-art long-term trackers. The source code is available at:

1 Introduction
Visual Object Tracking (VOT), the task of continuously locating an arbitrary
target in the first frame of a video, has been drawn attention in both aca-
demic and
