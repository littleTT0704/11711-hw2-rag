the number of questions for which the rank change of the first relevant passage or
title falls within that bracket. For instance, in experiments with Watson on regular
Jeopardy! questions, the rank of the top relevant text passage was not affected for
1,433questions, andthetoprelevanttitleimprovedbyupto5ranksfor438questions.
The number of questions for which relevant passages or titles were found only with SE
is illustrated by the bars on the right-hand side, and the number of questions lost in
the search phase due to SE is given by the bars on the left-hand side. Note that these
numbers are different from the results presented earlier because we used much longer
hit lists in this analysis. Questions for which no relevant results could be retrieved in
both the baseline experiment and the configuration with SE were omitted.
