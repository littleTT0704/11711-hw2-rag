 question is raised â€” How can we leverage targetdomain(real-worlddrivingscenarios)canhavedev-
the depth modality to counter the effect of noisy pseudo- astating consequences on the efficacy of deployed mod-
labels during self-training? In this work, we propose a els. Several approaches [5,14,18,30,35] have been pro-
contrastive objectness constraint derived from depth maps posed for learning domain invariant representations, e.g.,
and RGB-images in the target domain that is used to reg- throughadversarialfeaturealignment[6,14,49,54],which
ularise conventional self-training methods. The constraint addresses the domain gap by minimising a distance met-
