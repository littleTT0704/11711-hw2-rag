 years ago?".
(a)Least-to-MostMathReducingPrompt
Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice
(cid:44)→ 30 years old, how old is Kody?
Q: How old was Mohamed four years ago?
A: We were told that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, so he is currently 30 *
(cid:44)→ 2 = 60 years old. That means that four years ago he must have been 60 - 4 = 56
(cid:44)→ years old. The answer is 56.
Q: How old is Kody?
A: Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed, so Kody must have been 56 / 2 =
(cid:44)→ 28 years old then. Since Kody was 28 years old four years ago, she must now be 28
(cid:44)→ + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.
(b)Least-to-MostMathSolvingPrompt
# Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice
30 years old, how old is Kody?
# How old was Mohamed four years ago?
mohamed_age_current = 30 * 2
mohamed_age_4_years_ago = mohamed_age_current - 4
# Final Question: How old is Kody?
kody_age_4_years_ago = mohamed_age_4_years_ago / 2
kody_age_current = kody_age_4_years_ago + 4
answer = kody_age_current
