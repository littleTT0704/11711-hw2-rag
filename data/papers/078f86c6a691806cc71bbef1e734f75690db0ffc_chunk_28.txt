tional resources and time during training. Also, our work
only utilized specific self-supervised loss, network back-
bones, and hyper-parameters to support our hypothesis.
However, different aspects of learning have yet to be fully
exploited, e.g., learning hyper-parameters, additional un-
supervised loss L (adversarial loss, self-supervised loss).
