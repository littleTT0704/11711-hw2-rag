are sorted based on the number of target disappearances, which are indicated by the
number in parentheses.

Our RLT-DiMP achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
long-term trackers in the VOT-LT2019 benchmark. Our method has an F-score
of 0.007 higher than that of CLGS and an F-score of 0.014 lower than that
of LT DSE. For tracking precision, the proposed method achieves lower perfor-
mance than the top three trackers of the VOT-LT2019 benchmark. Notably,
we achieve the highest score in the tracking recall metric, which means that
our tracker is well modeled to be robust for long-term tracking through the
