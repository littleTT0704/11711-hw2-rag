Table 1: Implications of seroprevalence reports
• Santa Clara County, CA (SC) [2]: Concerns have been raised 4,5 regarding improper propagation
of uncertainty estimates in the original pre-print. In addition to the 95% confidence intervals reported
in the original preprint (SC-B), we also report the 95% confidence interval calculated with the PyStan
MCMC implementation 6 designed to correctly propagate uncertainties (SC-S).
• New York, NY (NY17, NY28): The state government has reported results of two seroprevalence
studies. These results have been shared at press conferences and recorded in news articles; however,
the full data is not currently available, so we calculate a point estimate of cˆ(t).
• Boise, Idaho (ID) [3]: An accurate antibody test used in Idaho’s “Crush the Curve” initiative in
late April.

of c(t). We look forward to the release of more seroprevalence studies which can be matched with numbers
of positive and negative diagnostic tests to estimate more recent values of c(t).

One strategy is to estimate an “undertesting” ratio to understand how to correct the observed number of
