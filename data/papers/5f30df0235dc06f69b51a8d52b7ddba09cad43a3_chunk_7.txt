4.2.HierarchicalRegionProposalNetwork
Traditional Region Proposal Network (RPN) treats all
objects in the same spatial level, and uniformly generates
dense anchors over the feature space. If we adopt a con-
ventionalRPNschemeandtraintheRPNwithbuildingand
damageproposalssimultaneously,thehierarchicalrelation-
ship between buildings and damaged parts will not be uti-
lized. Therefore, we propose a new model, termed Hier-
archicalRegionProposalNetwork(HRPN),toaddressthe
aforementionedproblems.
In HRPN, there are two RPNs sharing the same back-
bone network: a high-level RPN and a low-level RPN.
