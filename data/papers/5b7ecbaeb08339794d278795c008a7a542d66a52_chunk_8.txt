Coding scheme
Two coding schemes were developed based on the conceptual framework. To address
RQ1, we employed a two-stage coding exercise. As Benoit’s IRT (1995, 2015) offers the
most comprehensive image restoration framework and is widely adopted in crisis discourse
studies (e.g. Nekmat et al., 2014), we coded the presence of the crisis response strategies (i.e.
denial, evading responsibility, reducing offensiveness, taking corrective action, and
mortification) to reveal the CEOs’ use in apologies in the first stage. A total of 315 sentences
were collected from 20 corporate apologies. Only the dominant strategy used in each
sentence was coded. Table 2 illustrates the strategies and examples from the collected data,
and Appendix 2 provides illustrations of the coding of the dominant crisis response strategies.
