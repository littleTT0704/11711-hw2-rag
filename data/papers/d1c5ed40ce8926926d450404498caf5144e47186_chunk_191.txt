Table 8.4: P-values for all pairs of linear and sequential relevance models, based
on a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The null hypothesis is that the ranking
strategy to the left is as effective as the strategy at the top, the alternative is that
it is more effective. We show p-values for both sentence-level text nuggets (S) and
markup-based text nuggets (M).
for paragraphs than for sentences. This can be seen clearly when comparing the MAP
scores in Figures 5.2 and 5.3. Thus the degradation in ranking performance can be
attributed to the relevance model rather than the transition models.
The logistic regression model with features of adjacent text nuggets is already a
very strong baseline for relevance estimation with MAP scores of over 80%, and the
relevance features were specifically engineered and selected based on their impact on
a linear model. It should further be noted that the theoretical upper bound on MAP
in our experimental setup is not 100%. This is because some text nuggets are only
partially relevant and it is therefore not possible to perfectly separate relevant from
irrelevant text. Consider a simple example with two text nuggets, each consisting of
one relevant token followed by one irrelevant token. No matter how the two nuggets
are ranked, the relevant tokens are always separated by an irrelevant token. Since
we compute precision at each relevant token (cf. Section 5.2) both possible rankings
(cid:0) (cid:1)
have a MAP score of 1 1+ 2 = 83%. How closely we can approach 100% MAP in
2 3
practice depends on the granularity of the text nuggets, with the shorter sentence-
length nuggets leaving more headroom than the longer markup-based nuggets.
When scoring markup-based nuggets, the small improvement in MAP may not
justify the additional implementation effort for the sequential relevance model. For
instance, it seems unlikely that the sequential
