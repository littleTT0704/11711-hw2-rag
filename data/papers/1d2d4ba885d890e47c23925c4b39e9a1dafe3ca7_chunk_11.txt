Based on the above, the third research question regarding the use of intertextuality in the move
structure of leaders’ messages from the US and PRC was as follows:

RQ3: What were the differences between the types of intertextuality manifested in the moves of
corporate leader messages in Global 500 corporations in the US and PRC?
3. Methodology
3.1 Data Sourcing
The data used for the contrastive analysis was retrieved from the websites of Chinese and US
2017 Global 500 companies. Chinese and US companies were selected because the US remains
dominant in many aspects, whereas the PRC is rapidly becoming increasingly influential in
world affairs due to its booming economy (Ikenberry, 2008). According to 2017 Fortune Global
500 List, the US and PRC are the two countries accounting for the largest number of companies
making it to the List. Patton (2016) proposed that the contribution of the PRC to global GDP
would surpass that of the US by 2018. Therefore, understanding the professional behaviours of
the two largest powers enhances knowledge of cross-cultural communication between them
and other countries while a different use of intertextuality might be observed based on cultural
differences between the two countries.
This study selected corporate websites, which are the most typical type of owned media (Hanna,
Rohm, & Crittenden, 2011), as the data source. Corporate websites provide corporations with
unique functions and features to realise their communicative purposes (AUTHOR, 2014; 2017)
and offer an official platform for corporate leaders to make their voices widely heard.
3.2 Data Sampling

In order to sample comparable data, we selected corporate leader messages from the Chinese
and US companies listed on 2017 Fortune Global 500. The initial selection included 108
Chinese and 133 US companies. Of the 108 Chinese companies, 55 (51%) included leader
communication such as leader messages, chairman letters, and messages from CEOs on their
corporate websites, whereas 77 (58%) out of 133 US companies adopted similar practices. In
sum, 132 out of 241 companies from the PRC and the US employed leader communication on
their corporate websites. From the initial selection, we sampled the companies with leaders’
messages in the “About us”, “Company Profile” and “Who we are”, the easily accessible pages
on their websites that focused on communicating with
