diagnostic testing. Let the length of an active infection be 14 days, and the day that an individual with
an active infection is tested by uniformly distributed over the course of the infection. Then, the expected
number of positive tests on day t is
E (t)=E[n (t)∣z1(t),...,zN(t)]=(Z(t)−Z(t−14))T (t) (6)
