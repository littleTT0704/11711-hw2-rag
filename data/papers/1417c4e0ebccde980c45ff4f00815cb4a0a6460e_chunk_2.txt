This apparent resurgence has led to calls for additional public health strategies to reduce risk of infection.
However, there has also been public and scientific debate about the potential influence of increased testing
on the apparent increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This debate has led to the need to
disentangle the increase in the incidence from the increase in the number of administered tests; however,
few rigorous quantitative efforts have been reported. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to
disentangle these factors and then apply the model to identify states experiencing increases in SARS-CoV-2
incidence. Using this model, we are able to better estimate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, and rank the
states in terms of their incidence after correcting for expanded testing.
