 a
set of 32,476 questions selected randomly from episodes that are not part of our test
sets to approximate relevance and plot relevance curves. After finalizing the rankings
of the Wikipedia articles and Wiktionary entries, we performed the same analysis
on the 3,077 questions with known answers in the TREC 8â€“15 datasets to judge the
relevance of the seeds for the TREC task. The relevance curves for both Wikipedia
and Wiktionary, shown in Figure 6.1 for Jeopardy! and in Figure 6.2 for TREC, have
decreasing slopes. This indicates that popularity-based rankings indeed outperform
random rankings of the seeds, which are illustrated by straight lines. Of course this
analysis does not take into account whether a QA system could already answer a
question without SE, and by focusing on popular seeds we may bias the expansion
towards easy topics that were already well covered in the seed documents. However,
we will show in Section 6.3 that the expansion of popular Wikipedia articles has the
largest impact on QA search recall, and thus this approach for selecting relevant seeds
is clearly effective in practice.
Based on these relevance curves, we chose to expanded the top 300,000 Wikipedia
articles and the top 100,000 Wiktionary entries using content from web search re-
sults. In the merging step (cf. Section 4.4), text nuggets were dropped if more than
95% of their tokens were covered by higher scoring nuggets or the seed document.
In addition, the size of the expanded pseudo-documents was restricted to at most
5 times the length of the seeds, and nuggets with relevance scores below 0.1 were
removed. We analyzed a sample of pseudo-documents generated by the SE system
6.2. SOURCES 77
