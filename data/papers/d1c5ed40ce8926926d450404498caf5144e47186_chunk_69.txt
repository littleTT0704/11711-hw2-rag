 the feature and the AIC is
calculated. The model with the smallest AIC is then used as a new baseline for the
removal of additional features. This procedure is repeated until the AIC cannot be
reduced further by dropping more features.
Applied to the extended set of 55 relevance features, the backward elimination
algorithm selected 43 features, including all original features except Avg3GramCount
(which is similar to Known3GramRatio), 12 features of the previous nugget and 13
features of the next nugget. Among the selected features of adjacent nuggets are some
of the most predictive topicality features (TopicRatioSeed, TFIDFSeed, CosineSim
and 3rdPersonPronoun) and the feature that measures the overlap of a nugget with
the search engine summary (SearchAbstractCoverage). This intuitively makes sense
because those features allow conclusions about the relevance of nearby text. On the
other hand, features such as NuggetLength and NuggetOffset were dropped since they
do not add useful information for predicting the relevance of adjacent nuggets.
In preliminary experiments, we also evaluated other models that have been used
successfully for text categorization, such as support vector machines (with linear,
polynomial and radial basis function kernels), least squares linear regression and
na¨ıve Bayes classifiers. However, logistic regression outperformed all of these methods
on our relevance estimation task when using mean average precision (MAP) as the
performancemetric. Wealsofoundthatthismethodconsistentlyyieldsstrongresults,
