(M=2.5294), R3 (M=1.8824), R7 (M=1.4118) and R6 (0.2647) in the intertextuality employed
in Chinese leaders’ messages. Likewise, R1 was found to be the most commonly used source
of reference (M=9.3902) followed by R3 (M=3.0732), R4 (M=2.1951), R5 (M=1.5122), R2
(M=0.0244), R7 (M=1.2195) and R6 (M=0.2927) in US leaders’ messages. Figure 2 displays
the descriptive data on the sources of reference by intertextual types, and illustrates that R1
was often manifested in T3 while the widest range of sources was exhibited in T5.

Significant differences were noted in terms of the sources of intertextuality employed in both
Chinese (F(6,231)=12.286, p<0.0001) and US (F(2,280)=17.027, p<0.0001) leaders’ messages
(RQ2). The Tukey post hoc test indicated that R1 was statistically significantly higher than the
26
remaining Rs (CN: p<0.0001; US: p<0.0001) in leaders’ messages from both countries.
Corporate information is often exhibited in indirect speech (T3) to maintain an objective and
factual tone and the largest range of sources is manifested through recognisable phrasing and
terminology associated with particular documents (T4).
The t-test results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the presence of
R2 in
