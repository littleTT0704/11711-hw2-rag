B can also be estimated with logistic regression models. However, a different set of
t
features is required for predicting whether there is a transition between a relevant
and an irrelevant nugget given the text on both sides of a boundary. These transition
features were described in Section 8.2.1. We fit two separate transition models, one
for estimating P(L |L = 0,B ) and another for estimating P(L |L = 1,B ). The

first transition model is trained only on boundaries following text nuggets that were
labeled as irrelevant, and the second model is trained only on boundaries following
relevant text.
Givenestimatesoftheemissionprobabilitiesandtransitionprobabilities, aViterbi
decoder can be used to determine the most likely label sequence for a sequence of
text nuggets extracted from a document. For t ∈ {1,...,T} and i ∈ {0,1}, let
V (i) := max P(N...N,L...L L = i).
t 1 t 1 t−1 t
L1...Lt−1
Then the joint probability of the nugget sequence and the most likely state sequence
can be estimated as
max P(N...N,L...L ) = max V (i).

We can compute this probability using dynamic programming as follows:
V (i) = P(N,L = i) ∼ P(L = i|N ), (8.3)
