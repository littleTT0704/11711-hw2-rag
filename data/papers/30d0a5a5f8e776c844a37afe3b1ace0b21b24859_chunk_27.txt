a room and builds an internal representation of
the room’s configuration (sgoal). Then, in the Un-
shuffle phase, the agent is placed within the same
environment but objects within this environment
have been randomly moved to different locations
and opened/closed (sinit), the agent must now re-
store objects back to their original states. As this
2-phase RoomR is quite challenging, a 1-phase vari-
ant was also proposed where the agent enacts the
Walkthrough and Unshuffle phases simultaneously,
receiving egocentric RGB-D images of the environ-
ment in both the sinit and sgoal states at each step.
In the 2021 RoomR challenge, no participants were
able to outperform the baseline model, which used
