Now consider the question When were the first postage stamps issued in the United
States? (TREC 11, Question 1813). The article on Postage stamp in our copy of
Wikipedia only mentions the year (1847) and the relevant passage does not match
the question well enough to be retrieved by Watson. However, the expanded article
includes the text nugget Authorized by Congress the United States Government issued
the first adhesive postage stamp on July 1, 1847, whichperfectlymatchesthequestion
and is among Watson’s search results. This nugget also contains the complete answer
withtheexactdate, whichwasnotcoveredintheseedcorpus. Theexampleillustrates
