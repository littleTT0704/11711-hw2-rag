the range of their values and intuitive motivations, are listed below. The features are
computed at each boundary between text nuggets.

MarkupBoundary (binary). Whether the nugget boundary coincides with struc-
tural HTML markup, such as tags for paragraphs, table cells or items in a list. Tran-
sitions between relevant and irrelevant text often occur at such markup boundaries,
since different sections in a web page are less likely to be related than contiguous
text. Note that this feature is always true if nuggets are extracted based on markup
information, and thus it is only useful for the shorter sentence-level nuggets.
TextTiling (continuous). To measure the lexical coherence of the text at nugget
boundaries, we implemented four features derived from the TextTiling algorithm
[Hearst, 1997]. The simplest of these features, denoted CosSim, measures the cosine
similarity between word frequency vectors derived from windows of text on either
side of a given nugget boundary. More precisely, we tokenize the text and extract
a window spanning the n tokens that immediately precede a nugget boundary, and
an equally sized window spanning the tokens that follow the boundary. Function
words and punctuation marks are dropped, and the remaining tokens are normalized
by stemming them with an implementation of the Porter stemmer [Porter, 1980] and
converting them to lower case. Let W be the set of all normalized words that occur
i
in the two windows that are adjacent to the i-th nugget boundary, and let f (w)
i,1
and f (w) denote the frequencies of a word w ∈ W in the two windows. Then the
i,2 i
cosine similarity at the i-th boundary is defined as
(cid:80)
f (w) f (w)
i,1 i,2
CosSim(i) =
w∈Wi
.
(cid:114)
(cid:80) (cid:80)
f (w)2 f (w)2
i,1 i,2
w∈Wi w∈Wi
Note that Hearst [1997] computes cosine similarities based on plain word counts, but
one could also use tf-idf scores
