Rhetorical Framing of News. Prior work on
rhetoricalframing(e.g.NisbetandScheufele,2009;
Cardetal.,2015;Fieldetal.,2018)hasnotedthe
significantrolemediaframesplayinshapingpub-
licperceptionofsocialandpoliticalissues,aswell
as the potentialfor misleading representations of
eventsinnewsmedia. However,pastformalisms
for rhetorical framing that rely on common writ-
ingorpropagandatechniques(e.g. appealtofear
orloadedlanguage,DaSanMartinoetal.,2019)
do not explicitly model impact. To that end, we
proposeaformalismfocusingonreaders’percep-
tion of the writers’ intention, rather than specific
well-knowntechniques.
