ABSTRACT
With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents
tomanagedailytasksvianaturallanguagecommands. However,currentagents
areprimarilycreatedandtestedinsimplifiedsyntheticenvironments,leadingto
adisconnectwithreal-worldscenarios. Inthispaper, webuildanenvironment
forlanguage-guidedagentsthatishighlyrealisticandreproducible. Specifically,
we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment
withfullyfunctionalwebsitesfromfourcommondomains: e-commerce,social
forumdiscussions,collaborativesoftwaredevelopment,andcontentmanagement.
Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge
bases(e.g.,usermanuals)toencouragehuman-liketask-solving. Buildingupon
