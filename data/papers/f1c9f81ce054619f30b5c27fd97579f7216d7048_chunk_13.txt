Comparison by sequence with short-term trackers. Our RLT-DiMP
methodisanextendedversionbasedonapre-trainedshort-termtrackerwithim-
provedrobustnessforlong-termobjecttracking.Ourbaselinepre-trainedshort-
term tracker is SuperDiMP, which is a combination of the standard DiMP clas-
sifier [6] and the bounding-box regressor of PrDiMP [11] for better tracking. In
thissection,wecompareourlong-termtrackerwithvariousshort-termtrackers,
including the baseline tracker SuperDiMP and the individual methods of DiMP
[6]andPrDiMP[11].PrDiMP50andDiMP50aremethodsusingResNet50,and
PrDiMP18 and DiMP18 are methods using ResNet18 as a backbone. DiMP50-
VOT is another version designed to follow a reset protocol for the VOT-ST
benchmark. The rest of the PrDiMP- and DiMP-family all follow the no-reset
protocol, so these methods can be applied well in a long-term object tracking
environment.
Figure 6 shows the maximum F-score for each sequence on LTB50. All se-
quences are listed in order of the number of target disappearances. We can
observe that the baseline tracker SuperDiMP has better reasoning skills than
the individual methods of DiMP [6] and PrDiMP [11]. We emphasize that our
RLT-DiMP method outperforms the baseline tracker in almost all sequences.
Thisprovesthat ourmethod is more suitable forlong-term objecttracking, and
robust modeling via uncertainty reduction, robust random search, and back-
ground augmentation plays a significant role. This is analyzed in more detail
through ablation studies in the next section.
4.3 Further Evaluations and Analysis
Visual attributes on LTB50. In the LTB50 dataset, a total of 50 sequences
are annotated by nine visual attributes as follows: 1) Full occlusion, 2) Out-of-
view,
