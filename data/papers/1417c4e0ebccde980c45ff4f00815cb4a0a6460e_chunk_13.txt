testing ratio of approximately 0.5 for the United States. This ratio is likely to be drastically changing as
testing availability changes, while the relative propensity-to-test is more consistent. As we learn more about
the effects of SARS-CoV-2, we expect that estimates of undertesting ratios will be very helpful, but for this
novel disease we prefer the relative propensity-to-test c(t) as an interpretable parameter.

estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2. By using the pre-existing ILI detection systems to estimate
the increase in ILI disease prevalence, [5] obtain estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 incidence which are 5-50
times higher than reported by diagnostic tests and [6] obtain estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 incidence which
are also 5 times higher than reported by diagnostic estimates. This magnitude of undercounting has also
been reported by more recent analyses of city-level seroprevalence [7]. Our approach using the relative
propensity-to-test (c(t)) suggests that this undercounting magnitude may be realistic.
