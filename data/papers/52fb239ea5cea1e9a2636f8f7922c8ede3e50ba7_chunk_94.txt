 import Poly carry. If she gets paid 10 cents per
bottle and 3 cents per can, how
p = Poly(9*(x**2) + 3*x + 7 much money does she make (in

Generated Program:
answer = p.as_expr() a=20*6
b=a*2
print(answer) c=b*3
# ==> NameError (x is not d=c*10

named ROBUST-IR, ROBUST-AP, ROBUST-ADJ, ROBUST-Q, ROBUST-RQ,
and ROBUST-RM. ROBUST-IR refers to adding information that is unhelpful
for solving the question but may be related to the context of the problem.
ROBUST-AP refers to increasing problem verbosity by turning active speech to
passive speech. ROBUST-ADJ refers to increasing problem verbosity by adding
adjectives or adverbs. ROBUST-Q indicates turning a problem statement into a
question, in the style of a conversation with a student. ROBUST-RQ indicates
removing question words in a problem and turning it into a statement; it is
roughly the inverse of ROBUST-Q. Finally, ROBUST-RM refers to the removal
of mathematics terms that are implicitly defined. Examples of each template
are found in Table 16.
For our crowdsourcing pipeline, we provide each Amazon Mechanical Turk
worker with 10 questions split from 20 questions sampled from each dataset. We
run a separate job for each of our 9 templates. In particular, each HIT contains
the 10 split questions from the original datasets, alongside the problem solution.
Workers are asked to submit an augmentation for each question according to
the style of the template assigned to each job. Thus, we run 9 separate jobs
