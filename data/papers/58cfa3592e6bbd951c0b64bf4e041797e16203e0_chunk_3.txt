Preface
Turkishhasprovedtobeaveryinterestinglanguagefornaturallanguageprocessing
techniquesandapplications.TherehasbeenasignificantamountofworkonTurkish
since the early 1990s on introducing and/or adapting fundamental techniques,
compilingresources,anddevelopingapplications.
The idea for this book came after one of us gave an invited talk at the LREC
ConferenceheldinIstanbul,Turkey,in2012.Sincethen,theauthorsandwe have
worked hard to bring this effort to fruition. This book brings together most of
the work done on Turkish in the last 25 years or so. After a bird’s-eye overview
of relevant aspects of Turkish, it covers work on morphological processing and
disambiguation, statistical language modeling, speech processing, named-entity
recognition,dependency,anddeepparsing.Itthencontinueswithstatisticalmachine
translation from English to Turkish and from Turkic languages to Turkish and
sentimentanalysisforTurkish,atopicthathasrecentlybeenquitepopularwiththe

processing resources that have been developed for Turkish including the Turkish
WordNet, the Turkish Treebank,Turkish National Corpus, and Turkish Discourse
Bank.
We hopethatthisbookhelpsotherresearchersinadvancingthestate oftheart
for Turkish and possibly other Turkic languages that share nontrivial similarities
withTurkish.
