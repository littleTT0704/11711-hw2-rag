respects lexicalizationmay have a positive or negative influence. For some models
(especially suffering fromsparsedata),it may evenbe a better choiceto use some
kind of limited lexicalization instead of full lexicalization. The results from the
previous section suggests that the same is true for morphologicalinformation.
6 These results are not strictly comparable to those of other experiments, since the
training data were divided into smaller sets (based on the POS of the next token),
which reduced SVM training times without a significant decrease in accuracy.
7 Nouns appear with six different minor parts-of-speech in the treebank: noun, proper
noun, future participle, past participle, infinitive, zero. The latter four never contain
lemma information.

8 Optimized Parsing Model
After combining the results of the previous three sections, we performed a final
optimization of the feature model. We found that using minor parts-of-speech
instead of main parts-of-speech as the values of POS features and adding one
more LEX feature for the token after the next token gave a best overall perfor-
mance of AS U=76.0±0.2 AS L=67.0±0.3, and WW U=82.7±0.5. We also tested our
parser on two different subsets of the treebank. The first subset, which is used
by Eryig˘it and Oflazer [9] in order to evaluate their parser (giving AS U=73.5±1.0
and WW U=81.2
