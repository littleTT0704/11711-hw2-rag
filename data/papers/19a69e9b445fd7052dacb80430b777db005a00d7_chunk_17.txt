of shares, comments, and likes in relation to the subdimensions (mean 0.097, SEM 0.02) were used infrequently, with the use
of content, style, and interactive dimensions (RQ2). The of questions to solicit feedbackbeing used significantly less in
two-way ANOVA was performed to examine the interaction comparison to all other subdimensions (Figure 1c).
