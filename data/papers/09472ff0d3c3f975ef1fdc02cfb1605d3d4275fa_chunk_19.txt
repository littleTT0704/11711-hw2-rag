implementation, we used the SGD solver, 30 epochs, and batch size 128. The
learning rate starts with 0.004 for ResNet and 0.001 for AlexNet, learning rate
decayed by 0.1 after 24 epochs. For PACS experiment, we used the same data
augmentation protocol of randomly cropping the images to retain between 80%
to 100%, randomly applied horizontal flipping and randomly (10% probability)
convert the RGB image to greyscale, following [4].

results on different small networks and datasets. For fair comparison, we com-
pared RSC to their reported performances with their most common choices of
DNNs (i.e., AlexNet, ResNet18, and ResNet50) and datasets. RSC consistently
outperforms other competing methods.
TheempiricalperformancegainofRSCcanbebetterappreciatedifwehave
a closer look at the PACS experiment in Table. 6. The improvement of RSC
from the latest baselines [4] are significant and consistent: 4.5 on AlexNet, 5.2
on ResNet18, and 4.5 on ResNet50. It is noticeable that, with both ResNet18
and ResNet50, RSC boosts the performance significantly for sketch domain,
which is the only colorless domain. The model may have to understand the
semantics of the object to perform well on the sketch domain. On the other
