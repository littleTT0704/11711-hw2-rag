Diploma Ceremonies
In addition to the main commencement ceremony, each college/school/department will host a diploma ceremony to recognize all graduating students. Diploma ceremonies will be held over the course of the weekend (Friday, May 10–Sunday, May 12).
Diploma ceremonies will include the presentation of diplomas to graduates, hooding of doctoral candidates and remarks from their college/school/department leadership. Each ceremony is organized and customized by their college/school/department.
A student's department or college is determined by their major. Dual degree students who are receiving two diplomas may participate in both ceremonies, if scheduling permits.
Diploma ceremonies will take place both on and off campus. 
Diploma ceremonies typically include a reception and the length of time for each ceremony varies based on the number of graduates.
For diploma ceremonies on SUNDAY ONLY, please note that regardless of weather, all Sunday afternoon diploma ceremonies will start at their scheduled time.
