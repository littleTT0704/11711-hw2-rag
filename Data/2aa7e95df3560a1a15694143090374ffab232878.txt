Abstract
Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is an aggressive cancer affecting the peritoneal lining of the
abdominal cavity and intra-abdominal organs, with a median survival of ~2.5 years. We constructed an ‘MPeM
interactome’ with over 400 computationally predicted protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and over 4,700 known
PPIs of 59 literature-curated genes whose activity affects MPeM. Known PPIs of the 59 MPeM-associated genes
were derived from BioGRID and HPRD databases. Novel PPIs were predicted by applying the HiPPIP algorithm,
which computes features of protein pairs such as cellular localization, molecular function, biological process
membership, genomic location of the gene, and gene expression in microarray experiments, and classifies the
pairwise features as interacting or non-interacting based on a random forest model. 75.6% of the interactome and
65% of the novel interactors in it were supported by transcriptomic evidence in rodent and human peritoneal
mesothelioma/mesothelial cell lines and tumor specimens. 152 drugs targeted 427 proteins in the MPeM
interactome. Comparative transcriptome analysis of peritoneal mesothelioma-associated versus drug-induced
gene expression profiles revealed 39 repurposable drugs, out of which 29 were effective against peritoneal/pleural
mesothelioma and/or peritoneal metastasis/primary peritoneal cancer in clinical trials, animal models or cell lines.
Functional modules of chromosomal segregation, transcriptional deregulation, positive regulation of IL-6
production and hematopoiesis were identified from the interactome. Genes with tissue-specific expression in 2
sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis (spleen and thymus) and those correlated with unfavorable prognosis in
liver, renal, pancreatic and lung cancers were noted. MPeM interactome showed extensive overlap with the
malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) interactome and MPM cell line expression profiles. Our findings
demonstrate the utility of the MPeM interactome in discovering systems-level functional links among MPeM
genes and generating clinically translatable results such as repurposed drugs.

Introduction
Internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and body cavities, such as the thoracic and abdominal cavities, are
covered by a thin, slippery layer of cells called the “mesothelium”. Mesothelioma is a rare but highly aggressive
cancer that originates from this lining, is of types pericardial (heart), pleural (lung) and peritoneal (abdomen)
mesothelioma; it is usually found in advanced stages and has a median survival of one year.1 Mesothelioma is
intricately linked with exposure to asbestos but with a long latency period of few decades between exposure and
the occurrence of the disease and does not have a non-invasive pre-malignant phase unlike other cancers. The
focus of this work is on the genetics and biological mechanisms of MPeM.
1
The peritoneum is a serosal membrane made up of two layers of mesothelial cells lining the abdominal cavity and
intra-abdominal organs. MPeM affects this peritoneal lining and grows within the peritoneal space.1 Patients may
exhibit symptoms such as weight loss, shortness of breath, chest and abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth
and peritoneal effusion between the ages of 40-65 years.1 In contrast to pleural mesothelioma, where 80% of the
cases are linked to asbestos exposure, only 8% of peritoneal mesothelioma cases have a history of asbestos
exposure.2 Factors predisposing patients to MPeM are less clear.2 MPeM appeared to associate with germline
mutations more frequently than MPM.1 MPeM was more apparent among patients with a history of abdominal
surgeries rather than asbestos exposure.1 In this case, chronic inflammation resulting from the procedure is
presumed to have induced MPeM. Protracted inflammation of the peritoneum itself, or chronic peritonitis, seem
to also pose risk.2 MPeM has a higher median survival rate than pleural mesothelioma (31 months versus 14
months),3 and is currently treated with a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin, which elicits complete/partial
responses in 26% (i.e. overall response rate) and disease stabilization (i.e. stable disease rate) in 45% of the
patients.1
Several studies have speculated that the genetic factors driving peritoneal mesothelioma may be different from
those driving pleural mesothelioma. One observation supporting this hypothesis is that 5p15 and 7p12
chromosomal gains were more common in peritoneal than in pleural mesothelioma.4 Multiple studies have
examined the genetic underpinnings of MPeM. Hung et al. showed rearrangements in the gene ALK among a
subset of MPeM patients having no asbestos fibres, history of therapeutic radiation and other genetic aberrations
commonly found in MPeM tumors such as those in BAP1, SETD2 and NF2.5 Joseph et al. sequenced 510 cancer-
related genes in 13 MPeM patients.6 Ugurluer et al. analyzed 236 somatic cancer-related mutations in 4 MPeM
patients.7 Chirac et al. performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on samples collected from 33 French
MPeM patients.8 Foster et al. performed DHPLC (denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography) and
sequencing analysis on 29 MPeM samples.9 Hung et al. examined molecular features of 26 diffuse malignant
peritoneal mesothelioma using targeted next-generation sequencing.10 Pillai et al. investigated MUC1 expression
and other prognostic factors in relation to survival in 42 MPeM patients using immunohistochemistry.11 Varghese
at al. performed gene expression analyses on tumor samples collected from 41 MPeM patients who underwent
surgical cytoreduction and received regional intraoperative chemotherapy perfusion.12 Zaffaroni et al.
investigated the expression of survivin and the effects of survivin knockdown in 32 MPeM surgical specimens
and an established MPM cell line respectively.13 The next step to discovering biological mechanisms is to
understand how these genes play a role in the disease.
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) drive the biological processes in cells including signal transduction, formation
of cellular structures and enzymatic complexes. The molecular mechanisms of disease are often revealed by the
PPIs of disease-associated genes. For example, the involvement of transcriptional deregulation in pleural
mesothelioma pathogenesis was identified through mutations detected in BAP1 and its interactions with proteins
such as HCF1, ASXL1, ASXL2, ANKRD1, FOXK1 and FOXK2.14 PPI of BAP1 with BRCA1 was central to
understanding the role of BAP1 in growth-control pathways and cancer; BAP1 was suggested to play a role in
BRCA1 stabilization.15,16 Studies on BAP1 and BRCA1 later led to clinical trials of the drug vinorelbine as a
second line therapy for MPM patients, and the drug was shown to have rare or moderate effects in MPM
patients.17,18
Despite being critical to unravelling novel disease mechanisms and drugs, ~75% of estimated PPIs are currently
unknown and several disease-associated genes have no known PPIs. More than 600,000 PPIs are said to exist in
the human interactome19 and only ~150,000 PPIs are known from PPI repositories such as HPRD20 and
BioGRID21. Detecting the PPIs using experimental techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)22,23 is
prohibitively laborious and time-consuming at large scale. Tens of thousands of PPIs are being added into the
interactome through systematic high throughput studies with yeast two hybrid (Y2H) system24 and AP–MS25.
Despite this, a large part of the interactome remains unknown. We have previously developed a computational
2
model called HiPPIP (high-precision protein-protein interaction prediction) that was deemed highly accurate by
computational evaluations, and experimental validations of 18 predicted PPIs, where all the tested pairs were
shown to be true PPIs.26,27 We gained several high-impact biological insights from systems-level analysis of the
interactome of disease-specific proteins which also included predicted PPIs. We published 2,156 novel PPIs
related to MPM, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis and congenital heart disease.26,28-30. We constructed the MPM
interactome from which we experimentally validated 5 novel PPIs of MPM-associated genes and identified 5
repurposable drugs using comparative transcriptome analysis; biological validity of the interactome was shown
by the fact that more than 85% of this interactome was supported by genetic variant, transcriptomic and proteomic
evidence related to MPM.28 Our analysis of the schizophrenia interactome resolved the apparent disconnect
between schizophrenia GWAS genes and risk genes discovered in the pre-GWAS era, by showing that they
belong to common pathways.26 We showed interactome overlap between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis
that may explain their shared pathology and inverse epidemiological relationship,29 a link between cilia, neuronal
function and neurological disorders,31 the central role of cilia in congenital heart disease,30 and the role of
mitochondria in hypoplastic left heart syndrome.32 We were able to shortlist 12 repurposable drugs based on an
integrated computational analysis of the schizophrenia drug-protein interactome;33 two of these drugs are in
clinical trials as adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia (ClinicalTrials.gov ; ). Most
recently we showed how the genes associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma identified by various high
throughput studies were functionally linked within the mechanistic framework of the protein interactome.34
In this work, we constructed the ‘MPeM interactome’ by assembling the known and computationally predicted
PPIs of the genes associated with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, and studying pathways and biological
processes associated with it. We analysed this interactome in the context of peritoneal mesothelioma
transcriptomic datasets, tissue specificity of the constituent genes and their prognostic significance in other related
cancers. We extended the MPeM interactome to include the drugs that target any of its proteins and analyzed it
to identify a shortlist of 29 drugs that can potentially be repurposed for MPeM.
Results
We compiled a list of 59 genes associated with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) from nine studies;5-
13 these genes harboured mutations, copy number aberrations, rearrangements or showed expression correlated
with poor prognosis in MPeM patients or reduced cell survival or less favorable response to drugs in MPeM
surgical specimens (Supplementary File 1). PPIs of these genes were collected from HPRD20 (Human Protein
Reference Database) and BioGRID21 (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets). The HiPPIP
algorithm described in our earlier work was applied to MPeM genes to discover hitherto unkown PPIs.35 HiPPIP
computes features of protein pairs such as cellular localization, molecular function, biological process
membership, genomic location of the gene, and gene expression in microarray experiments, and classifies the
pairwise features as interacting or non-interacting based on a random forest model.26 The ‘MPeM interactome’
assembled in this manner contained 4,747 known PPIs and 417 novel PPIs connecting 58 MPeM-associated genes
to 2,747 known interactors and 306 novel interactors (Fig. 1 and Supplementary File 2). The 59th MPeM-
associated gene ADAM3A had neither known nor novel PPIs.
The number of known and computationally predicted novel PPIs for each of the MPeM genes are shown in Fig.
2 and Table 1; the novel interactors are listed in Table 1. 13 genes had 10 or less interactions each and 73 novel
PPIs were predicted for all of the genes combined. There are 21 hub-genes that had more than 75 known PPIs
each and 160 novel PPIs were predicted for all of the genes combined.

mesothelioma (MPeM) interactome: Genes are shown as nodes and PPIs as edges. As the complete MPeM network
is very large, only a partial view showing a large connected component of MPeM candidate genes and their novel
interactors, all of which have MPeM-related transcriptomic evidence (Supplementary Table X), is shown. Legend:
dark blue square-shaped nodes: MPeM candidate genes; red nodes/edges: novel interactors/interactions; light blue
nodes and blue edges: known interactors/interactions.
Figure 2. Number of Protein-Protein Interactions: The MPeM associated genes are listed along the x-axis,
5 arranged in the ascending order of their number of known protein-protien interactions. The number of novel predicted
PPIs and previously known PPIs are shown as red bars on primary axis (left) and blue line on secondary axis (right).
For example, DPYD has three known PPIs and 8 novel PPIs, and AR has 265 known and zero novel PPIs.
Functional modules in the MPeM interactome
We used the HumanBase toolkit36 (https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/) to identify functional modules in the MPeM
interactome. HumanBase employs shared k-nearest-neighbors and the Louvain community-finding algorithm to
cluster the genes sharing the same network neighborhoods and similar Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes,
into functional modules. 14 modules were detected of which 11 had more than 4 proteins each; 13 modules were
enriched for the following biological processes: M1: chromosome segregation (Q-value (false discovery rate
adjusted p-value) <1E-08), M2: translation (Q-value <1E-08), M3: hemopoiesis (Q-value <1E-08), M4: covalent
chromatin modification (Q-value <1E-08), M5, M9 and M10: transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase
signaling pathway (Q-values of <1E-08, 2.82E-04 and 2.64E-03 respectively), M6: histone modification (Q-value
<1E-08), M7: mRNA metabolic process (Q-value <1E-08), M8: cell-cell adhesion (Q-value = 2.86E-05), M11:
negative regulation of intracellular signal transduction (Q-value = 3.98E-03), M12: negative regulation of
hydrolase activity (Q-value = 5.84E-03), M13: cell-cell junction assembly (Q-value = 5.97E-03) and M14:
positive regulation of interleukin-6 production (Q-value = 0.023). When novel interactors were not included, 9
modules of which all had 4 or more proteins each were detected. 52 novel interactors co-occurred with their
corresponding MPeM-associated genes in these five modules: M3: IRS2-EDEM1, JUN-GPR18, JUN-PML,

Biological Process and Pathway Associations
We identified the Reactome pathways enriched in the MPeM interactome using the gene set analysis toolkit called
WebGestalt (Supplementary File 3).37 WebGestalt computes the statistical significance of association of the
genes with a specific functional group (e.g. a Reactome Pathway) using Fischer’s exact test and Benjamini-
Hochberg method for multiple test adjustment. The top-30 pathways associated with the MPeM are shown in

Tissue-specificity of the genes in the MPeM interactome
Figure 3. (A) Tissue-specificity of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) interactome genes in human
organs: Tissue-specific expression of the genes in the interactome was examined using GTEx data. The graph shows
the number of genes from the interactome that exhibit tissue specificity. The genes show at least 5-fold higher
expression in a tissue (‘tissue-enriched’) or a group of 2-7 tissues compared to all the other tissues (‘group-enriched’).
(B) Tissue-specificity of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) interactome genes in mouse organs: Tissue-

We studied tissue specific expression of the proteins in the interactome using mouse ENCODE and GTEx
data.39,40 Genes with an expression level greater than 1 TPM (transcripts per million) and relative expression at
least 5-fold higher in a particular tissue (tissue-enriched) or a group of 2-7 tissues (group-enriched) were
considered.41 Only two abdominal organs were found among the top-10 organs that showed enrichment in the
interactome, namely, spleen and small intestine (Fig. 3A). This was contrary to the expectation that most of the
genes in the interactome may show tissue specificity in abdominal organs lined by the peritoneum. Instead, the
human organs that shared many genes with the interactome were brain, testis, skin, lung, heart, esophagus, artery
and muscle (Fig. 3A). Similar specificity was observed in mouse organs/tissues such as intestine, cortex,
cerebellum, olfactory bulb, testis and bone marrow, and embryonic tissues such as E14.5 brain, E14.5 placenta
and E14.5 heart (Fig. 3B). The interactome showed statistical significance for enrichment in human orthologs of
genes showing tissue-specific expression in mouse spleen (81 genes, P-value = 0.019, odds ratio = 1.39) and
thymus (57 genes, P-value = 0.028, odds ratio = 1.42) (Fig. 3B). 10 MPeM-associated genes had novel PPIs with
the orthologs of 10 spleen-specific mouse genes, namely, SMARCB1-VPREB3, JAK1-VNN2, RHEB-NOS3,
ALK-NLRC4, IRS2-MPO, TSC1-FCN1, RICTOR-CTSW, HRAS-CCL4 and BIRC5-AANAT (MPeM genes are
listed first in each pair) (i.e. 10 novel interactors had spleen-specificity).
We checked whether any of the genes in the interactome showed tissue-specific expression in the peritoneum
using BaseSpace Correlation Engine.42,43 In this case, a gene was considered to be specific to a particular tissue,
if the decrease in its expression in each of the other tissues relative to the tissue of interest is greater than 0.8,
among a list of tissues ranked by expression intensity (i.e. specificity index > 0.8). By this definition, only 6 genes
were considered to exhibit peritoneum-specific expression based on data from array-based gene expression
studies. Nevertheless, OVGP1 which was predicted as a novel interactor of the MPeM-associated gene DPYD
exhibited moderate specificity for peritoneum (specificity index = 0.57).
Overlap of the MPeM interactome with transcriptomic datasets
198 out of 306 (65%) novel interactors, and 2,353 (75.6%) proteins overall of the MPeM interactome, showed
differential gene expression in pre-clinical models and human tumor specimens of peritoneal mesothelioma
(Supplementary File 4). These included human orthologs of genes that were differentially expressed in
spontaneous or chemically induced peritoneal mesothelioma in rats, peritoneal mesothelioma cell lines cultured
from mice exposed to crocidolite asbestos, or genes differentially expressed in MPeM tumor specimens, or human
peritoneal mesothelial lines that were exposed to crocidolite. The interactome was significantly enriched in genes
differentially expressed in granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) from spleens of mice
bearing AB12 mesothelioma grafts versus naive neutrophils (975 genes, P-value = 2.02E-14, odds ratio = 1.21),
neutrophils infiltrating AB12 mesothelioma tumor grafts versus naive bone marrow derived neutrophils (1,006
genes, P-value = 1.97E-17, odds ratio = 1.24) (GSE4325444) and BCA induced peritoneal mesothelioma versus
non-transformed mesothelial cell line (533 genes, P-value = 1.08E-04, odds ratio = 1.15). A considerable number
of genes in the interactome were differentially expressed in rat models of spontaneous and induced peritoneal
mesothelioma, but their overlaps were not statistically significant. Specifically, 332 genes including 26 novel
interactors were identified in o-Nitrotoluene (O-NT) induced peritoneal mesothelioma versus non-transformed
mesothelial cell line (GSE468245), and 794 genes including 57 novel interactors in spontaneous malignant
mesotheliomas from 2-year-old rats versus normal mesothelial Fred-PE cells (GSE4758146). The interactome
showed statistically significant overlaps with genes differentially expressed in two asbestos-exposed human
peritoneal mesothelial cell lines, namely, LP9 mesothelial cells exposed for (i) 8 hours to 5ug/cm2 crocidolite
asbestos (GSE1403447: 303 genes, P-value = 6.39E-08, odds ratio = 1.32, GSE6396648: 560 genes, P-value =
1.24E-05, odds ratio = 1.16), and (ii) 8 hours to 1ug/cm2 crocidolite asbestos (GSE1403447: 85 genes, P-value =
8.76E-04, odds ratio = 1.38), versus untreated mesothelial cells, and primary peritoneal mesothelial HM3 cells
exposed to 5ug/cm2 crocidolite asbestos for 8 hours (GSE6396648: 797 genes, P-value = 3.99E-12, odds ratio =
1.22).

In order to examine whether the interactome showed preferential enrichment for any specific subtype of peritoneal
mesothelioma, we computed its overlap with genes found to be differentially expressed in biphasic versus
epithelial peritoneal mesothelioma tumor specimens and vice versa.49 Significant enrichment was found with
biphasic mesothelioma (118 genes, P-value = 2.17E-19, odds ratio = 2.25), but not with epithelial mesothelioma
(15 genes). This overlap included 4 genes predicted as novel interactors of 4 MPeM-associated genes (MPeM
genes are shown in bold): ARID1A-TAF12, PIK3CA-LYPLA1, EPHB1-MRPL3 and KEAP1-LONP1. Out of
the 15 genes in the interactome that showed specific expression in the epithelial subtype, 2 were predicted as
novel interactors of MPeM-associated genes: VEGFB-SF1 and SUZ12-PLA2G2A.
Diffuse MPeM is known to share similar clinical presentation, morphology and immunostaining profiles with
ovarian/primary peritoneal serous carcinoma (OC/PPC), and may hence be indistinguishable from the latter.50
Gene expression signatures characterizing these two tumors have been identified in an attempt to elucidate the
molecular differences distinguishing them from one another.50 We computed the overlap of the MPeM
interactome with these expression profiles. Out of the 12 genes in the interactome found to be differentially
expressed in OC/PPC versus diffuse MPeM (including the MPeM-associated gene ESR1), 3 were predicted as
novel interactors of MPeM-associated genes: HRAS-IGF2, JUN-TACSTD2 and CHEK2-SUSD2. 8 genes
including the MPeM-associated gene KDR were found to be differentially expressed in diffuse MPeM versus
OC/PPC.
A recent study had examined the gene expression profiles from the lungs of mice exposed to asbestos fibers
(crocidolite and tremolite), an asbestiform fiber (erionite) and a mineral fiber (wollastonite).51 Crocidolite,
tremolite and erionite are capable of inducing lung cancer and mesothelioma in human and animal models.51 On
the other hand, wollastonite is a low pathogenicity fiber that shows no association with the incidence of lung
cancer and mesothelioma in humans, or carcinogenesis in animal models.52 The MPeM interactome showed high
statistical significance for genes differentially expressed upon exposure to crocidolite (322 genes, P-value = 3.5E-
13, odds ratio = 1.44) and marginal significance for genes differentially expressed upon wollastonite exposure
(23 genes, P-value = 0.044, odds ratio = 1.43). No enrichment was observed with erionite (13 genes) and tremolite
(64 genes).
In summary, these overlap studies (a) ascertained the biological validity of the MPeM interactome by showing
that it contained genes that were biologically relevant to MPeM in the context of rodent xenograft/cell line
mesothelioma models and human mesothelial cell lines, (b) highlighted genes that were specific to MPeM
subtypes and those that help in distinguishing MPeM from other morphologically and histogenetically similar
tumors, and (c) suggested a mechanistic framework to examine genes that appeared to be linked to MPeM
etiology, based on transcriptomic evidence .
Disease associations We systematically analyzed the overlap of the MPeM interactome with prognostic genes of
20 cancer types. Data for correlation of gene expression and fraction of the patient population surviving after
treatment for various cancer types were taken from Pathology Atlas.53 Genes with log-rank P-value < 0.001 were
considered to be prognostic. A positive correlation of high gene expression with reduced patient survival is
considered unfavourable prognosis, whereas its correlation with increased patient survival is considered
favourable. The interactome showed significant enrichment of genes associated with both prognosis for 6 cancer
types, and either one type of prognosis for 10 other cancer types. The most significant enrichments were noted
for unfavorable prognosis in liver cancer (P-value = 1.35E-25, odds ratio = 1.43), renal cancer (P-value = 3.57E-
18, odds ratio = 1.31), pancreatic cancer (P-value = 4.18E-09, odds ratio = 1.51) and lung cancer (P-value =
4.01E-07, odds ratio = 1.62). The most significant enrichments for favourable prognosis were noted in testis
cancer (P-value = 7.7E-03, odds ratio = 2.72), breast cancer (P-value = 8.23E-03, odds ratio = 1.29), thyroid
cancer (P-value = 0.013, odds ratio = 1.41), and melanoma (P-value = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.81).

We studied the association of the interactome genes with diseases in the DisGeNET database.54 The top-5 diseases
that were associated with MPeM were prostatic neoplasms (odds ratio = 1.98), mammary neoplasms (odds ratio
= 2.48), stomach neoplasms (odds ratio = 2.41), liver carcinoma (odds ratio = 2.34) and lung neoplasms (odds
ratio = 2.32), all at P-value < 1E-15. Several novel interactors were found to be associated with these diseases.
For example, 13 novel interactors of MPeM-associated genes were associated with prostatic neoplasms (MPeM
genes are shown in bold): MET-SLC26A4, DPYD-SULT2A1, CTNNB1-LAMB2, IRS2-MPO, HRAS-
ZFP36L2, VEGFB-UCP3, PRDM1-HPGD, NSD1-NPR3, KEAP1-SLC5A5, MET-FOXA3, RHEB-NOS3,
HRAS-HBG1 and JAK1-CBR1. We employed Phenogrid from the MONARCH toolkit55 to identify the diseases
that were most phenotypically similar to MPeM. The phenogrid algorithm identifies the common phenotypes
between two given diseases. It then assesses the information content in each of these phenotypes (gene and disease
associations) to assign a specific strength to the similarity observed between the diseases. Ovarian fibroma (OF),
desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and primary peritoneal carcinoma
(PPC) are highly phenotypically like MPeM (similarity score > 80). We compiled 6, 43, 24 and 49 genes
associated with OF, DSRCT, BCS and PPC respectively and checked their enrichment in the MPeM interactome.
Statistically significant enrichment was shown by the genes associated with DSRCT (P-value = 4.16E-04, odds
ratio = 2.31) and PPC (P-value = 5.72E-08, odds ratio = 2.98). Out of the 17 DSRCT-associated genes found in
the MPeM interactome, 2 were MPeM-associated genes (WT1 and SMARCB1), and out of the 25 PPC-associated
genes, 9 were MPeM-associated genes (DPYD, TP53, CHEK2, BRIP1, MRE11, PTEN, EGFR, KDR and ALK)
and 2 were novel interactors (COL11A2 and ALB) of 2 MPeM-associated genes (DAXX and KDR).
Using MONARCH,55 we checked the enrichment of genes associated with 8 MPeM-associated
phenotypes/clinical symptoms in the MPeM interactome, namely, ileus (intestinal obstruction preventing passage
of intestinal contents), peritonitis (peritoneal inflammation), pedal edema (fluid accumulation in the feet and lower
legs), ascites (fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity), dyspnea (labored breathing), abdominal pain,
abdominal distention and abnormality of coagulation. The highest significance was shown by abdominal pain (P-
value = 1.23E-09, odds ratio = 2.17), which was followed by pedal edema (P-value = 1.97E-07, odds ratio =
3.24), dyspnea (P-value = 1E-07, odds ratio = 1.81), abdominal distention (P-value = 5.4E-05, odds ratio = 2.04),
abnormality of coagulation (P-value = 1.61E-03, odds ratio = 1.89) and ascites (P-value = 0.01, odds ratio = 1.65).
Genes associated with ileus and peritonitis showed non-significant overlaps with the interactome; 3 out of the 16
ileus-associated genes and 2 out of 5 peritonitis-associated genes were found in the interactome. Overall,
mutations in 14 novel interactors were found to be linked to these 8 disease symptoms (the MPeM-associated
genes are shown in bold, and where marked with * showed the same phenotype association as their novel
interactors): peritonitis, ascites and abdominal pain in humans: peritonitis, ascites and abdominal pain in humans:
KEAP1-LONP1; dyspnea in humans: JUN-JUN, CTNNB1*-LAMB2, MAPK8-MT-CO1, EPHB1-MRPL3,
KMT2A-TGFB2; abdominal pain in humans: KDR-KIT, ALK*-DNMT3A, BIRC5-GCGR; abdominal
distention in humans: MET*-SLC26A4, SUZ12-SLC2A2, KEAP1-SLC5A5, MET*-SLC26A3; and,
coagulation abnormality in humans: WT1-PEX3.
Interconnections to Pleural Interactome
We compared the overlap of MPeM interactome with the malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) interactome.34
The two interactomes had 989 genes in common, which is a highly significant overlap (P-value = 3.18E-289,
odds ratio = 2.92). This overlap included 4 core genes that were associated with MPM and MPeM (BAP1,
CDKN2A, KDR and WT1), 29 PPIs between MPM and MPeM core genes, of which one is a novel PPI, 21 novel
interactors of MPM and MPeM candidate genes, with the rest being known interactors. 38 MPM-associated genes,
41 MPeM genes and the 4 genes common between them formed an intricately interconnected network of PPIs
(Fig. 4). 6 of these are novel PPIs (FLT1-FLT3, TUBA1A-TUBA1C, RHGAP22-MAPK8, DPYD-SRC, JUN-
GART and TSC1-TUBB4B).
10
Also, the MPeM interactome showed enrichment for several human MPM cell lines, including NCIH2052 (P-
value = 1.45E-47, odds ratio = 1.26), H2373/PPMMill (P-value = 3.27E-29, odds ratio = 1.35) and Hmeso (P-
value = 4E-12, odds ratio = 1.39) (GSE5144756).

Potentially repurposable drugs for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma
We followed the established approach of comparing drug-induced versus disease-associated differential
expression57 to identify drugs for MPeM. For this, we used the software suite BaseSpace Correlation Engine
(https://www.nextbio.com),42,43 which allows users to study the effect of diseases and/or drugs on thousands of
pre-processed publicly available gene expression datasets and has helped to identify repurposable drug candidates
for schizophrenia33 (currently undergoing clinical trials) and mesothelioma34 in the past. We constructed the
MPeM drug-protein interactome that shows the drugs that target any protein in the MPeM interactome. 152 drugs
were found to target 427 proteins in the MPeM interactome, including 16 MPeM-associated genes, 361 known
interactors and 50 novel interactors. We selected 5 gene expression datasets associated with peritoneal
mesothelioma, namely, granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) from spleens of mice bearing
AB12 mesothelioma grafts versus naive neutrophils, neutrophils infiltrating AB12 mesothelioma tumor grafts
versus naive bone marrow derived neutrophils (GSE4325444), BCA induced peritoneal mesothelioma versus non-
transformed mesothelial cell line, O-NT induced peritoneal mesothelioma versus non-transformed mesothelial
cell line (GSE468245) and spontaneous malignant mesotheliomas from 2-year-old rats versus normal mesothelial
Fred-PE cells (GSE4758146). Then, we compiled a list of chemical compounds whose differential gene expression
profiles (drug versus no drug) were negatively correlated with at least one of the 5 peritoneal mesothelioma
differential gene expression datasets (disease versus control). Following this methodology, we identified 22 drugs
11
negatively correlated with BCA induced peritoneal mesothelioma, 19 correlated with O-NT induced peritoneal
mesothelioma, 24 correlated with spontaneous malignant mesothelioma, 5 correlated with G-MDSCs from the
spleens of AB12 xenografts and 7 correlated with AB12 graft infiltrating neutrophils. Although in each case there
were some genes that were differentially expressed in the same direction for both the drug and disorder, the overall
effect on the entire transcriptome had an anti-correlation (Supplementary Files 5-9). We identified 39 drugs as
potentially repurposable candidates for MPeM. Literature review supported the biological validity of 29 (74%)
out of these 39 drugs (Fig. 5), including 2 drugs (paclitaxel: NCT04000906 and imatinib: NCT00402766) that
are already in clinical trials for MPeM. The evidence supporting these drugs is:
 Two drugs are part of the standard therapy for mesothelioma58 (pemetrexed and vinorelbine).
 One drug has shown activity against peritoneal mesothelioma, pleural mesothelioma and peritoneal metastasis
(irinotecan). Although ineffective as a single agent,59 irinotecan elicited modest response rates and showed
an acceptable toxicity profile in malignant pleural mesothelioma clinical trials, and produced an inhibitory
effect on mesothelioma cell lines in combination with a p53 activator.60-62 Irinotecan was shown to be
effective and tolerable in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal seeding.63 Importantly, irinotecan in
combination with cisplatin showed efficacy and tolerability against peritoneal mesothelioma in a clinical
setting.64
 Two drugs have shown activity against peritoneal mesothelioma in clinical settings and peritoneal metastasis
in clinical trials/cell lines (paclitaxel and sirolimus). Paclitaxel appeared to be ineffective against MPM both
as a single agent as well as in combination with other agents such as filgrastim and cisplatin.65-67 However, it
has led to the complete remission of an MPeM patient for 20 months,68 and clinical efficacy and an acceptable
toxicity profile in ovarian, pancreatic and gastric cancers with peritoneal metastasis or serosal exposure.69,70
Sirolimus inhibited proliferation and increased cell death in MPM cell lines in combination with cisplatin,
inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in peritoneal mesothelial cell lines, and showed clinical
efficacy in a patient with benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma.71-73
 Twelve drugs have shown activity against malignant pleural mesothelioma in clinical trials, animal models or
cell lines (epirubicin, panobinostat, doxorubicin, imatinib, vinblastine, idarubicin, azacitidine, vorinostat,
dactinomycin, acetylcysteine, staurosporine and quercetin). Epirubicin has shown a modest 10-20% response
rate in malignant mesothelioma patients.74 Panobinostat has been shown to have an inhibitory effect in
mesothelioma cell lines and tumors in murine xenograft models.75 Doxorubicin has shown tolerable toxicity
and improvement in the quality of life of MPM patients.76 Imatinib has shown both cytotoxicity and apoptosis
in PDGFRB-positive mesothelioma cell lines, and has shown modest clinical efficacy in malignant
mesothelioma patients.77,78 Vinblastine has shown improved progression-free survival rate and acceptable
toxicity in combination with methotrexate and platinum.79-81 Both idarubicin and dactinomycin showed
more cytotoxicity in MPM cell lines compared with pemetrexed and cisplatin.82 Azacitidine has shown
inhibitory activity against malignant mesothelioma in clinical trials.83 Vorinostat induced apoptosis in
mesothelioma cell lines.84 However, it did not provide any therapeutic benefit in patients with pleural
mesothelioma.85 Acetylcysteine and quercetin have shown dose-dependent inhibition and time- and dose-
dependent inhibition in malignant mesothelioma cell lines respectively.86-88 Staurosporine was effective
against mesothelioma tumors in murine xenograft models.89
 6 drugs have shown activity against primary peritoneal cancer or peritoneal metastasis in other cancers
(ruxolitinib, daunorubicin, dasatinib, topotecan, dexamethasone and nintedanib). The gene expression profile
induced by ruxolitinib was shown to be negatively correlated with all the 5 peritoneal mesothelioma datasets.
Ruxolitinib in combination with paclitaxel has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse model of
advanced ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastasis.90 Daunorubicin induced side effects and showed no
clinical activity against MPM.91 However, treatment with daunorubicin led to complete remission of a gastric
Kaposi’s sarcoma patient with peritoneal metastasis.92 Dasatinib showed inhibitory activity against peritoneal
12
metastasis in a murine xenograft model of gastric cancer.93 Topotecan demonstrated clinical efficacy and
tolerability in primary peritoneal carcinoma.94 Dexamethasone protected peritoneal mesothelial cells from
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by acting on MAPK, GSK-3β and SNAI1.95 Nintedanib has been shown
to inhibit peritoneal fibrosis in a mouse model by blocking mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.96
 4 drugs have shown activity both against malignant pleural mesothelioma and peritoneal metastasis or
sclerosis (methotrexate, resveratrol, everolimus and genistein). Methotrexate was shown to be clinically
active against MPM in combination with gemcitabine, and against peritoneal metastasis in advanced gastric
cancer.79,97-99 Everolimus induced AMPK/p38-mediated apoptosis in MPM cell lines and showed clinical
activity in encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.100-102 Resveratrol has produced an inhibitory effect on
mesothelioma cell lines as a single agent as well as in combination with clofarabine, and has inhibited the
adhesion of ovarian cancer cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells in vitro.26,103-105 Genisten has shown inhibitory
activity against matrix metalloproteinases in malignant mesothelioma cell lines, and against peritoneal
metastasis in intestinal adenocarcinomas in Wistar rats.106,107
 Two drugs have been shown to be effective in pleural/peritoneal effusions (mitoxantrone and vincristine)
Mitoxantrone has shown only modest clinical activity in malignant mesothelioma.108 However, this drug has
shown activity against pleural effusions in cancer patients.109 Vincristine was active against malignant
peritoneal effusions in a murine xenograft model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.110

Discussion
MPeM constitutes a substantial percentage (15%-20%) of all mesothelioma diagnoses and is additionally notable
for its distinction from pleural mesothelioma, such as its limited association with asbestos exposure and
proportionally higher prevalence in comparison with MPM among patients with germline mutations and without
a history of asbestos exposure (25% versus 7%111).1 In addition to this, three other factors that underscore the
importance of MPeM-centric studies include the highly variable pattern of disease progression that it exhibits,
risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality, and the increasing prevalence of peritoneal cases among
mesothelioma patients without occupational exposure (given the current scenario in which the population of
asbestos-exposed individuals is diminishing).1 42% of MPeM patients survived for at least 5 years after
cytoreductive surgery (CRS); however, instances of accelerated disease progression and death and survival for a
long time with active disease have also been reported, indicating the variable nature of MPeM outcomes.1 A
postoperative morbidity (complications and adverse events arising from the surgical procedure) of 35% and a
mortality rate varying from 2% to 6% have been reported in patients who received CRS or hyperthermic
intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), indicating the variable nature of surgical outcomes.1 Given the
unique features of MPeM and its fatal nature, it is imperative that the molecular mechanisms underlying this
disease are expeditiously discovered.
Although multiple studies have examined the genetic basis of MPeM,5-13 a mechanistic framework to interrogate
its underlying cellular mechanisms and the functional consequence of the genes identified in these studies in an
integrative manner is still lacking. In this study, we employed the protein interactome to discover the biological
coherence of MPeM-associated genes identified in disparate studies, noting that MPeM may develop when PPIs
are perturbed by genetic mutations or aberrant expression of MPeM-associated genes/proteins, ultimately leading
to disrupted cellular functions.112 Extensive inter-connectivity and intra-connectivity of the network components
in the human PPI network may augment the spreading of the effects of such perturbations to other proteins,
encoded by genes that may/may not harbor any disease-associated alterations, through the network of their
interactions, posing deeper implications for disease development, e.g. comorbidity, shared genetics and
symptomatology among diseases and phenotypic responses to drugs.112 We constructed the MPeM interactome
with more than 4,700 known interactions and more than 400 novel interactions of MPeM-associated genes
collected from 9 studies, and conducted functional enrichment and transcriptome-based analyses to establish the
biological validity of the interactome, gain valuable insights into MPeM etiology and identify drugs that may be
repurposed to treat MPeM.
A key finding from our study was that more than 75% of the interactome as a whole, and more than 60% of the
novel interactors that were predicted to interact with MPeM-associated genes by the HiPPIP algorithm, had
MPeM-related transcriptomic aberrations in rodent and human cell line models. This demonstrates the validity of
our interactome-based method due to two reasons: we (a) identified other genes that were previously identified
in MPeM-related gene expression studies using an unbiased approach from the MPeM interactome, and (b)
showed that they were closely connected to a curated set of MPeM-associated genes and that they could be
functionally relevant to MPeM etiology in an interdependent manner. Another key finding was that more than
70% of the repurposable drugs that we identified using comparative transcriptome analysis has been shown to be
effective against peritoneal mesothelioma, pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal metastasis and/or primary peritoneal
cancer in clinical trials, animal models or cell lines. The drug-associated expression profiles analyzed in this study
were induced in a wide variety cell lines. The effect of the proposed drugs should be specifically examined in
human peritoneal mesothelioma cell lines or animal models.
Human orthologs of spleen-specific and thymus-specific mouse genes showed significant enrichment in the
interactome, instead of major abdominal organs. This finding seemed to be in line with the identification of
hematopoiesis as a functional module enriched in the MPeM interactome. Both spleen and thymus are
14
hematopoietic sites regulating the proliferation, maturation and activation of lymphoid cells outside of the bone
marrow (extramedullary hematopoiesis). Expansion of myeloid cells in the spleen through the process of
extramedullary hematopoiesis resulting in splenomegaly has been observed in BAP1 knockout mice.113 Further
investigations may be necessary to elucidate the functional consequences of this phenomenon in MPeM. 56%
(33) of the MPeM-associated genes that we had used for interactome construction were involved in chromosomal
events such as copy number gain/loss, gene loss, deletion and gene rearrangement. In line with this, chromosome
segregation was identified as the most enriched functional module in the interactome. We identified 10 novel
interactors involved in chromosome segregation, out of which 7 were predicted to interact with MPeM-associated
genes involved in chromosomal events (indicated with *; MPeM genes are shown in bold): RASSF1*-LARS2,
ESR1-KATNA1, ARID1B*-MTHFD1L, RHEB*-CENPE, VEGFB*-TFB1M, TP53-ZNF367, ASXL1-
POLD1, JUN*-GART, PTEN*-KIF20B and KEAP1*-SENP1. Transcriptional deregulation seemed to be
critical to MPeM etiology, as indicated by the identification of functional modules involved in covalent chromatin
modification and translation; together, these modules contained 53 novel interactors of MPeM-associated genes.
Elevated expression of an anti-apoptotic factor called survivin (BIRC5) induced by the cytokine IL-6 has been
reported in MPeM patients; knockdown of this gene led to increased (spontaneous and drug-induced) apoptosis.13
In line with this, positive regulation of IL-6 production has been identified as an enriched functional module,
which also includes 13 novel interactors of MPeM-associated genes: NR2F2-SYCP3, ESR1-DDX43, RB1-
LRCH1, RB1-PCDHB5, MRE11-GPR83, PBRM1-FBXW8, RB1-CDADC1, MET-FOXA3, RB1-CNTN3,
SMARCB1-MYO18B, TRIO-DNAH5, ARHGAP22-ZNF488 and SDHB (and MTOR)-SLC45A1. Future
studies could concentrate on validating the novel PPIs involved in these functional modules relevant to MPeM
etiology and the extensive interconnections noted among MPeM-associated genes (of which only a portion has
been shown in Fig. 1).
As noted earlier, a higher prevalence of MPeM compared to MPM has been observed among carriers of germline
mutations.1 These mutations (e.g. in BAP1 and TP53) may predispose MPeM patients to multiple other cancers.1
We identified a significant enrichment of genes, whose elevated expression positively correlates with (a)
unfavourable prognosis in liver, renal, pancreatic and lung cancers and (b) favourable prognosis in testis, breast,
thyroid and skin cancers, in the MPeM interactome. Prolonged survival has been reported in mesothelioma
patients with germline mutations, indicating that these mutations may sometimes mediate inhibition of aggressive
tumor growth.1 Additionally, prolonged survival has been associated with the occurrence of other cancers in
carriers of germline mutations.1 Genetic screening to identify aberrations in prognostic genes may guide clinicians
in patient stratification (based on their survival time and risk of developing other cancers) and in devising better
treatment strategies.
We showed extensive overlap of the MPeM interactome with the MPM interactome, interconnections between
MPeM-associated genes and MPM-associated genes in the interactome and significant enrichment of the MPeM
interactome in MPM cell lines. Further investigations focused on these findings may provide clues on the
etiological diversification and common genetic underpinnings of MPeM and MPM.
In summary, our study provides a network-level view of MPeM-associated genes and their functional
consequences. The MPeM interactome will serve as a functional landscape to integrate and analyse MPeM related
multi-omics data and will inform and catalyze future investigations on the genetic basis of MPeM and biomedical
studies seeking to improve clinical interventions in MPeM.

Methods
Compilation of MPeM-associated genes and prediction of novel interactions
A list of 59 MPeM-associated genes that harboured mutations, copy number aberrations, rearrangements or
showed expression correlated with poor prognosis in MPeM patients or reduced cell survival or less favorable
response to drugs in MPeM surgical specimens was compiled from eight studies.5-13 Novel PPIs of the proteins
encoded by these genes were predicted using the HiPPIP model that we developed.35 Each MPeM protein (say
N1) was paired with each of the other human proteins say, (M1, M2,…Mn), and each pair was evaluated with the
HiPPIP model.35 The predicted interactions of each of the MPeM proteins were extracted (namely, the pairs whose
score is >0.5, a threshold which through computational evaluations and experimental validations was revealed to
indicate interacting partners with high confidence). The interactome figures were created using Cytoscape.114
Identification of functional modules
Functional gene modules were extracted using the HumanBase toolkit36 (https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/).
HumanBase uses shared k-nearest-neighbors and the Louvain community-finding algorithm to cluster the genes
sharing the same network neighborhoods and similar GO biological processes into functional modules. The p-
values of the terms enriched in the modules are calculated using Fisher’s exact test and Benjamini–Hochberg
method.
Functional enrichment analysis
Biological process (Gene Ontology115), pathway (Reactome116) and disease (DisGeNET54) enrichments were
computed using WebGestalt.37 WebGestalt computes the distribution of genes belonging to a particular functional
category in the input list and compares it with the background distribution of genes belonging to this functional
category among all the genes that belongs to any functional category in the database selected by the user.
Statistical significance of functional category enrichment is computed using Fisher's exact test, and corrected
using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple test adjustment. Annotations with FDR-corrected p-value <
0.05 were considered significant.
Tissue-specific expression analysis
Tissue-specificity of the genes in the MPeM interactome were checked using TissueEnrich.117 The analysis was
based on tissue-specific genes compiled from GTEx and Mouse ENCODE.39,40 This included ‘tissue-enriched
genes’ with at least 5-folds higher mRNA levels in a particular tissue compared to all the other tissues, ‘group-
enriched genes’ with at least 5-folds higher mRNA levels in a group of 2-7 tissues and ‘tissue-enhanced genes’
with at least 5-folds higher mRNA levels in a particular tissue compared to average levels in all tissues.
Network overlap analysis
Statistical significance of the overlaps between genes in the MPeM and MPeM interactomes was computed based
on hypergeometric distribution.
Identification of prognostic cancer genes
Data for correlation of gene expression and fraction of patient population surviving after treatment of 20 cancer
types was taken from Pathology Atlas.53 Genes with log-rank P-value < 0.001 were considered to be prognostic.
Unfavorable prognosis indicates positive correlation of high gene expression with reduced patient survival.

Identification of repurposable drugs
The list of chemical compounds whose gene expression profiles correlated negatively with 5 gene expression
datasets associated with peritoneal mesothelioma were compiled using the BaseSpace correlation software
(https://www.nextbio.com) (List 1). The datasets considered were granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(G-MDSCs) from spleens of mice bearing AB12 mesothelioma grafts versus naive neutrophils, neutrophils
infiltrating AB12 mesothelioma tumor grafts versus naive bone marrow derived neutrophils (GSE4325444), BCA
induced peritoneal mesothelioma versus non-transformed mesothelial cell line, O-NT induced peritoneal
mesothelioma versus non-transformed mesothelial cell line (GSE468245) and spontaneous malignant
mesotheliomas from 2-year-old rats versus normal mesothelial Fred-PE cells (GSE4758146). Next, we identified
drugs that targeted at least one gene in in the MPeM interactome using Drug Bank.118 We then compared list 1
and list 2 to identify the drugs that not only target proteins in the interactome but are also negatively correlated
with MPeM-associated gene expression profiles.
