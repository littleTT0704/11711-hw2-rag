Abstract
As Machine Translation (MT) has become
increasingly more powerful, accessible, and
widespread, the potential for the perpetua-
tion of bias has grown alongside its advances.
Whileovert indicatorsofbias havebeenstud-
ied in machine translation, we argue that
covert biases expose a problem that is further
entrenched. Through the use of the gender-
