The volume, nature and origin of continental crust that existed
on Earth before 3 Ga is poorly understood. One of the greatest
obstacles in addressing these topics is the apparent paucity of
preserved ancient (>3 Ga) crust. Despite being one of the largest
Archean nuclei on Earth, the record of ancient crust in the Rae
craton is virtually unexplored. Previous work has hinted at the
presence of pre-3 Ga crust at the southern [1] and western [2]
margins of the craton, but the true aerial extent, age, nature and
origin of that ancient crust is unknown.
In this study, we present whole-rock Sm-Nd isotope and
elemental data, and zircon U-Pb, Hf and O isotope data, for
granitoids from the western margin of the Rae craton. Samples
with crystallization ages >3.0 Ga and/ or Sm-Nd depleted mantle
model ages >3.2 Ga define an ~1000 x 100 km belt that stretches
from central Canada to the Arctic coast, which we call the
Kugyoak terrane. Pre-3.0 Ga granitoids from this terrane are
broadly similar in composition to typical Archean tonalite-
trondhjemite-granodiorite [3]. These granitoids yield
crystallization ages between 3.25 and 3.07 Ga, initial zircon εHf
values between +3 and -2, mantle-like zircon O isotope
compositions and rare ca. 3.3 Ga inherited zircon.
Collectively, these data show that one of the largest Paleo to
Mesoarchean terranes on Earth was previously unrecognized,
and that this terrane represents a volumetrically significant
addition of juvenile ca. 3.3–3.1 Ga continental crust. Granitoids
from this giant terrane yield little-to-no evidence for interaction
with the large volumes of pre-3.5 Ga continental crust (up to
45% of present-day continental volume) that are inferred from
proxy records, such as detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf isotope data, to
have been present at the time of its formation [4].
