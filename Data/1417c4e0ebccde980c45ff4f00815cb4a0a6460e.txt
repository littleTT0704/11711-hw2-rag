Abstract
To design effective disease control strategies, it is critical to understand the incidence of diseases.
In the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States (caused by outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus), testing
capacity was initially very limited and has been increasing at the same time as the virus has been
spreading. When estimating the incidence, it can be difficult to distinguish whether increased numbers
of positive tests stem from increases in the spread of the virus or increases in testing. This has made it
verydifficulttoidentifylocationsinwhichtheepidemicposesthelargestpublichealthrisks. Here,weuse
a probabilistic model to quantify beliefs about testing strategies and understand implications regarding
incidence. We apply this model to estimate the incidence in each state of the United States, and find
that: (1)theCovid-19epidemicislikelytobemorewidespreadthanreportedbylimitedtesting,(2)the
Covid-19epidemicgrowthinthesummermonthsislikelysmallerthanitwasduringthespringmonths,
and (3) the regions which are at highest risk of Covid-19 epidemic outbreaks are not always those with
the largest number of positive test results.
Introduction
In mid-June 2020, the number of positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection began to increase in
selected US states for the first sustained period since the epidemic appeared to peak in early-April 2020.
This apparent resurgence has led to calls for additional public health strategies to reduce risk of infection.
However, there has also been public and scientific debate about the potential influence of increased testing
on the apparent increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This debate has led to the need to
disentangle the increase in the incidence from the increase in the number of administered tests; however,
few rigorous quantitative efforts have been reported. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to
disentangle these factors and then apply the model to identify states experiencing increases in SARS-CoV-2
incidence. Using this model, we are able to better estimate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, and rank the
states in terms of their incidence after correcting for expanded testing.

have changed the procedures for reporting this number over the course of the epidemic.
As expected from mechanics of epidemic spread, both the number of positive tests and the estimated
incidence were initially higher in the states with a higher population density than in the states with a lower
population density (see Fig. 3 for a depiction of population densities). For example, the estimate of daily
incidence in NY reached a peak in mid-April, while the estimates of daily incidence in AZ and TX have
slowly increased over time. More recently, states such as MN, NV, AZ, TX, and FL have seen an uptick in
the rate of positive test counts — according to our model, NV had the greatest level of epidemic spread.2
Finally, many of the curves of the estimated incidence grow at a slower rate than the rate of increase
in the number of positive test results. This could happen for two reasons which cannot be distinguished
without representative community testing: (1) either testing availability is expanding at a faster rate than
the true epidemic is spreading, or (2) the true value of c(t) is decreasing over time. These explanations are
not mutually exclusive, and in fact, (2) is likely to be a consequence of (1). We expect that the value of c(t)
is decreasing over time because testing availability is increasing, and thus the curve of true incidence does
not follow any one of the curves plotted for a fixed c(t). As the testing availability continues to increase and

Figure 2: The unadjusted weekly spread of Covid-19 cases (top) generally outpaces the weekly spread
adjusted for expanded testing (bottom). In some cases, such as NV, the adjusted spread could imply a
larger problem than is obvious from the unadjusted increase in positive test counts.
States Most at Risk for an Increase in Incidence Are Not Always the Same as
States with the Most Positive Cases
Fig. 2 shows the weekly increase in positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (top) alongside the weekly change in our
estimate of daily incidence (bottom). To calculate the corrected daily incidence, we compute Eq. 9 for each
day. Forboththeuncorrectedandthecorrectedincidences, wereportthepercentagechangefromthe7-day
average ending on June 29, 2020 to the 7-day average ending on July 6, 2020. These results show that the
majority of states have uncorrected levels of SARS-CoV-2 spread which are larger than the changes in the
estimated incidence after correcting for increased testing.
In addition, the ranking of the states most at risk for increased SARS-CoV-2 spread changes after
correcting for increased testing. The 5 states with largest percentage increase in positive test counts were
MT, ID, WV, DE, and AK, while the 5 states with largest increase in our estimate were NV, VT, SC, MS,
and WA.
We also examine the relationship between population density and the weekly change in the estimated
incidence. As shown in Fig. 3, in the earlier months of the epidemic there was a weak positive correlation
betweenpopulationdensityandtheweeklychangeinestimatedincidence.3 However,inthesummermonths,
we see that there is a negative correlation between these two features.
3State-level counts of positive and negative test results were not available before late March, so the initial outbreak of the

Figure 3: In the earlier months (left), there was a weak positive correlation between population density and
epidemic spread. More recently (middle), there is a negative correlation between population density and
epidemic spread. The Spearman correlation coefficient between population density and weekly change in
estimated incidence (right) has gone from positive to negative through the course of the epidemic.
Proportionally-Increasing Positive Counts are Indistinguishable from Expanding
Testing Without Knowledge of Testing Protocols
A counter-intuitive statistical property which is made clear by this model is that an increasing number of
positive tests does not necessarily increase the estimated incidence. Specifically, Eq. 5 shows that increasing
the number of positive tests alongside a proportionate increase in the number of negative tests does not
affect the estimated cumulative incidence. This represents the counter-intuitive property that if we observe
only the counts of test results, an exponentially-spreading infection is statistically indistinguishable from
exponentially-growing testing capacity unless we have extra information about the testing protocols. For
instance, we can consider a infection which is fixed in some proportion of the full population (i.e. not
spreading). In this hypothetical case, if testing were to grow at an exponential rate, then the counts of
positive tests would grow at a similar exponential rate without the infection spreading at all. Thus, if we
believe the incidence of the epidemic is truly increasing while the proportion of positive tests is remaining
the same, then we must implicitly believe that the testing protocol is changing over time. Our parameter
c(t) provides a way to quantify this change.
Discussion
In this paper, we describe the development of a novel probabilistic model to estimate incidence of SARS-
CoV-2 while adjusting for testing protocols. The model incorporates test results and a single, interpretable
free parameter which was estimated from several external epidemiologic studies.
Weusedtheresultsfromourmodeltoevaluaterecentepidemicspreadineachofthe50states. Wereport
substantial differences between unadjusted and adjusted incidence for selected states. These results can be
usedtohelpinformstatepolicy-makersabouttheselectionandimplementationofpublichealthpoliciesand
strategies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our analysis also found that the state’s population density, which
was previously positively correlated with increasing incidence, is more recently negatively correlated.
This study has several limitations. First, our results are dependent upon the quality of the external
studies. However, we used several seroprevalence studies to provide a range of reasonable parameter values
and minimize our dependence upon an individual study. Second, our model does not project future spread,
such as could be done with a mechanistic model (e.g., SIR model; [1]). Third, our model uses test results,
which are dependent on both test availability and usage, as well as test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity,

to estimate the free parameter, thus minimizing reliance upon a single external study or type. Second,
this parameter can be re-estimated as results of new external studies become available. In particular,
representative seroprevalence studies in localities with reported test counts will improve the estimation of
the free parameter in our model. Third, our model has no other external inputs such as symptomatic rates
which are difficult to estimate for a novel virus. Fourth, our model can be applied repeatedly and at various
geographic levels to help inform public health decisions including re-opening of different localities.
Inconclusion, wehavedevelopedarobustprobabilisticmodeltoestimateincidenceandepidemicspread

use to assess epidemic spread. Decision-makers can consider these estimates of incidence to inform public
policy and avoid relying solely upon diagnostic test counts.
Methods
We have N individuals in the population. At each time t, we observe the following random variables:
• n (t), the number of individuals who test positive on day t
dp
• n (t), the number of individuals who tested positive up to and including day t
p
• n (t), the number of individuals who test negative on day t
dn
• n (t), the number of individuals who tested negative up to and including day t
n
In addition, we have the unobserved latent variables:
• zi(t), whether individual i has truly been infected
• ti(t), whether individual i has been tested
Finally, let T (t) denote the probability that an uninfected individual will be tested, and T (t) denote the
n p
probability that an infected individual will be tested, i.e. T (t)=P(ti(t)=1∣zi(t)=0), and T (t)=P(ti(t)=
n p
1∣zi(t)=1). We then define
T (t) P(ti(t)=1∣zi(t)=1)
c(t)= p = (1)
T (t) P(ti(t)=1∣zi(t)=0)
n
i.e. an infected individual is a factor of c(t) more likely to be tested than an uninfected individual.

Intuition
The central assumption underlying our model is that infected individuals are more likely than uninfected
individuals to receive diagnostic tests. The parameter c(t) quantifies this bias toward testing SARS-CoV-2-
infected patients: large values of c(t) indicate a large preference for testing SARS-CoV-2-infected patients,
while a value of c(t)=1 indicates no prejudice between testing SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-SARS-CoV-
2-infected patients.
Estimating c(t)
To estimate the free parameter c(t), we use seroprevalence as a measure of Z(t) and calculate the implied
c(t). In contrast to the diagnostic tests, which have relied on patients seeking treatment for their disease,
representative seroprevalence studies attempt to get an unbiased view of a region by randomly selecting
participants and re-weighting demographic groups to reflect a broader population. Each study provides a
view of Z(t) which implies a particular c(t):
Nn˜ (t) n˜ (t)
cˆ(t)= p − p (10)
Z˜(t)n˜ n(t) n˜ n(t)
In Table 1, we show the value of cˆ(t) implied by the reported value of Z(t) in the following seroprevalence
studies:

Related Work
A few other works have proposed estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 from limited testing.
One strategy is to estimate an “undertesting” ratio to understand how to correct the observed number of
cases. Unfortunately,theundertestingratiocanbedifficulttoestimateforanoveldiseasebecauseitrequires
knowledgeofthedistributionofoutcomesfromcontactwiththeinfectiousagent. Forexample,[4]estimates
theundertestingratiobycomparingcasefatalityratiosbetweenlocalities,andarriveatanestimatedunder-
testing ratio of approximately 0.5 for the United States. This ratio is likely to be drastically changing as
testing availability changes, while the relative propensity-to-test is more consistent. As we learn more about
the effects of SARS-CoV-2, we expect that estimates of undertesting ratios will be very helpful, but for this
novel disease we prefer the relative propensity-to-test c(t) as an interpretable parameter.
Ourresultsconcordmorewiththeapproachof[5,6]touseinfluenza-likeillness(ILI)detectionsystemsto
estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2. By using the pre-existing ILI detection systems to estimate
the increase in ILI disease prevalence, [5] obtain estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 incidence which are 5-50
times higher than reported by diagnostic tests and [6] obtain estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 incidence which
are also 5 times higher than reported by diagnostic estimates. This magnitude of undercounting has also
been reported by more recent analyses of city-level seroprevalence [7]. Our approach using the relative
propensity-to-test (c(t)) suggests that this undercounting magnitude may be realistic.
