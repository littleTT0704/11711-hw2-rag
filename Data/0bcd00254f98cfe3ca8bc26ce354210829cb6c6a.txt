Abstract
Background: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (interactomes) of most organisms, except for some model
organisms, are largely unknown. Experimental methods including high-throughput techniques are highly resource
intensive. Therefore, computational discovery of PPIs can accelerate biological discovery by presenting “most-
promising” pairs of proteins that are likely to interact. For many bacteria, genome sequence, and thereby genomic
context of proteomes, is readily available; additionally, for some of these proteomes, localization and functional
annotations are also available, but interactomes are not available. We present here a method for rapid
development of computational system to predict interactome of bacterial proteomes. While other studies have
presented methods to transfer interologs across species, here, we propose transfer of computational models to
benefit from cross-species annotations, thereby predicting many more novel interactions even in the absence of
interologs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Clostridium difficile (CD) have been used to demonstrate the work.
Results: We developed a random forest classifier over features derived from Gene Ontology annotations and
genetic context scores provided by STRING database for predicting Mtb and CD interactions independently. The
Mtb classifier gave a precision of 94% and a recall of 23% on a held out test set. The Mtb model was then run on
all the 8 million protein pairs of the Mtb proteome, resulting in 708 new interactions (at 94% expected precision)
or 1,595 new interactions at 80% expected precision. The CD classifier gave a precision of 90% and a recall of 16%
on a held out test set. The CD model was run on all the 8 million protein pairs of the CD proteome, resulting in
143 new interactions (at 90% expected precision) or 580 new interactions (at 80% expected precision). We also
compared the overlap of predictions of our method with STRING database interactions for CD and Mtb and also
with interactions identified recently by a bacterial 2-hybrid system for Mtb. To demonstrate the utility of transfer of
computational models, we made use of the developed Mtb model and used it to predict CD protein-pairs. The
cross species model thus developed yielded a precision of 88% at a recall of 8%. To demonstrate transfer of
features from other organisms in the absence of feature-based and interaction-based information, we transferred
missing feature values from Mtb orthologs into the CD data. In transferring this data from orthologs (not
interologs), we showed that a large number of interactions can be predicted.
Conclusions: Rapid discovery of (partial) bacterial interactome can be made by using existing set of GO and
STRING features associated with the organisms. We can make use of cross-species interactome development, when
there are not even sufficient known interactions to develop a computational prediction system. Computational
model of well-studied organism(s) can be employed to make the initial interactome prediction for the target

studied organisms enabling accurate predictions for organisms with no annotations. These approaches can serve as
building blocks to address the challenges associated with feature coverage, missing interactions towards rapid
interactome discovery for bacterial organisms.
