Research prioritization through prediction of
future impact on biomedical science: a position
paper on inference-analytics

Abstract
Background: Advances in biotechnology have created“big-data” situations in molecular and cellularbiology.
Several sophisticated algorithms have been developed that process big data to generate hundreds ofbiomedical
hypotheses (or predictions). The bottleneck to translating this large number of biological hypotheses is thateach of
them needs to be studied by experimentation for interpreting itsfunctional significance. Even when the predictions
are estimated to be very accurate, from a biologist’sperspective, thechoice ofwhich of these predictions is to be
studied further is made based on factors like availability of reagents and resourcesand the possibility of formulating
some reasonable hypothesis about its biological relevance. When viewed from a global perspective, say from that
ofa federalfunding agency, ideally thechoice ofwhich prediction should be studied would be made based on
which of them can make themost translationalimpact.
Results: We propose that algorithmsbe developed to identify which ofthecomputationally generated hypotheses
have potential for hightranslational impact; this way, funding agencies and scientific communitycan invest
resources and drive theresearch based ona global view of biomedical impact without being deterred bylocal
view of feasibility. In short, data-analytic algorithms analyze big-data and generate hypotheses; incontrast,the
proposed inference-analytic algorithms analyze these hypotheses and rank them by predictedbiologicalimpact.We
demonstrate this through the development of analgorithm to predict biomedical impact of protein-protein
interactions (PPIs) which is estimatedby the number of future publications that cite thepaper which originally
reported the PPI.
Conclusions: This position paper describes a new computational problem that is relevant inthe era of big-data
and discusses thechallenges that existinstudying this problem,highlighting the need for thescientific community
to engage inthis line ofresearch. The proposed class of algorithms, namely inference-analytic algorithms,is
necessary to ensurethat resources are invested intranslating thosecomputational outcomes that promise
maximum biologicalimpact.Application of this concept to predict biomedical impact of PPIs illustrates not only
theconcept,but also the challenges in designing these algorithms.
