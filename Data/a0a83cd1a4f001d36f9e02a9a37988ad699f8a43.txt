Learnermodelsarewidelyusedtoindividualizeinstructioninintelligenttutorsand
othereducationallearningenvironments.Learnermodelsareoftenevaluatedbytheir
abilitytopredictlearnerperformance,andconsiderableresearchhasgoneintoimprov-
ing their predictive accuracy. However, improvements in predictive accuracy do not
necessarily translate into improved learning gains, greater insight into learning, or
betterinstruction.Forthisspecialissueweinvitedpapersonlearnermodelingwith

tomodeldomain-specificknowledge,inordertoimprovelearningoutcomes.These
models were typically employed in one of two ways: to individualize VanLehn’s
(2006) “inner loop” functions (providing help messages to students during learning
tasks) and/or to individualize “outer loop” functions (sequencing the curriculum of
successivelearningtasks).
Of course, learner modeling still focuses predominantly on improving domain-
specificlearningoutcomes.Effortstomodeldomain-specificstudentknowledgealso
remain central in learner modeling, and these models have been extended both in
whatismodeled(e.g.,depthofknowledge),andhowtheyareused(e.g.,toevaluate

a rich flowering in student-modeling efforts that are focused on creating conditions
thatcanfosterdomain-specificlearninggains.Thesenotablyinclude:
– monitoring various metacognitive learning strategies, self-assessment, and self-
regulationactivities;
– monitoringstudentaffect,engagement,andmotivation;
– monitoringstudents’collaborativelearningskills;and
– usingstudentmodelingtoevaluatelearningmaterials.
Handinhandwiththeseefforts,thetypesofstudentbehaviorsthatserveasevidencefor

The four papers in this special issue nicely span this greatly diversified space of
studentmodeling.Theyincludeawiderangeoflearningtasks,fromlearninghistorical

importantgoalsincludeimprovingmetacognitivetaskdecompositionstrategies,self-
assessment, self-regulation, and learner perseverance. What all of the papers have
in common is that they employ their student models to individualize the students’
learningexperiencesandtheyexaminetheimpactoftheirstudentmodelingactivities

In the first article, Satabdi Basu, Gautam Biswas, and John Kinnebrew report on
Learner modeling for adaptive scaffolding in a Computational Thinking-based sci-

study examines several models of students’ factual knowledge and the use of these
models for the outer-loop function of automatically designing successive multiple-
choice questions. The learners in this study are using outlinemaps.org, an online
learning environment for geography facts, but the modeling efforts are intended for
any factual learning environment in which learners may vary widely in background
