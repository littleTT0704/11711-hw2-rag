An automatic image capture system was developed, providing accurate analysis for the nanoparticle

X 32 Mega Pixel USB camera with a capture rate of 30 Frames per Second (FPS) in video mode and
animageresolutionof1280×1024.LabVIEWwaschosenbysupportingavarietyofdriversthatallow
the programmer to implement any supported camera instantly without direct consideration of the driver
itself, reducing complexity and time. LabVIEW was the language to develop the automation side of the
system with NI Vision Acquisition Software (VAS) being a suite of drivers that support the acquisition
andsavingofimagesfromalargerangeofcamerastandards.

LabView VAS was used which is suitable to create a live video, giving best observation results. For
instance, the grab.vi provides a VI (Virtual Instrument) that runs once and captures a single image

ensurethatthecameraattemptstocaptureanimagebeforeanerrorisgenerated.
A specific feature of the control system was the ability to choose the file directory and to create the
filename(Fig. 3).Inadditiontothis,itwasconsideredusefulfortheprogramtoincrementthefilename

2.2. Thedevelopmentanddesignofanelectromagnet
A DC electromagnet (Fig. 4(a)) was developed since a constant magnetic field was required for the
nanofilleralignmentprocess.Ithasbeenshown [5]thatthedesiredalignmentofGNPswithinanepoxy

AnironC-corewithdimensionsof100×170×30 mmwitha110 mmgapwasusedwithtwoseparate
I-cores with dimensions of 100 × 30 × 30 mm. The I-cores were used to enable varying of the air gap
to the required size, which in this case was determined by the width of glass microscope samples. The
sample slides are a standard 76.2 × 25.4 × 1 mm with the applied epoxy specimen typically having an
areaof20×20 mm.Theairgapwasdeterminedtobe30 mmtoallowtheslidetobepositionedwithin
theairgap.
With the maximum field and gap in the core determined, Ampere’s Law was used as a starting point
forthedesignoftheelectromagnet.

A3Dbracketwasdesignedtoholdthesampleinthecentreoftheairgap(Fig. 4(b)).
2.3. Automationoftheelectromagnet
As automation is a key component to the system specifically via software, the electromagnet needed
to be controllable for the user. In order to conform to the previous design for image capture, LabVIEW
was again used for this purpose. A Kepco Bipolar Operational Power Supply was provided with ±36 V
and ±12 A output, BOP 36-12M [6]. The PSU has two modes of operation; voltage limiting mode and
currentlimitingmodebothwiththeabilitytobeeitherfrontpaneladjustedorremotelyprogrammed.In
ordertooperatethePSUbyremotecontrol,acontrolpotentialof0to±10 Vmustbeappliedtopreamp
B(Fig. 5) [7]tooperatetheoutputcurrentlinearlythroughouttherangeofthePSU.
As the maximum current required for the electromagnet was known to be 4 A, the potential across
preamp B for the PSU was calculated by dividing the 0 to ±10 V control potential across the range of
±12 Vresultingin±1 Vofcontrolpotentialproducing±1.2 A.Fromthis,4 AwasoutputfromthePSU
by applying a control potential of 3.35 V. In order for the control potential to be user determined with
software,aDACwasneededinordertoconvertanysignalsproducedbyaPCintoananalogueDCvoltage.
AsthecontrolsoftwarewastobedesignedinLabVIEWitwasnecessarytouseanNIcompatibleDAC
with LabVIEW support. An NI S-series 6115 data acquisition (DAQ) PCI card was installed into the
resident PC. The DAQ consists of a number of DACs and Analogue to Digital Converters (ADCs) with
various analogue and digital input and output (I/O) namely a nominal analogue output voltage range of

cardwasidealforremotecurrentcontrol.TheNISCC-68isanI/Oconnectorblockforsignalconnection
to an NI DAQ device that consists of a breadboard area for I/O signal connections and bus terminals
for power connections [9]. The connector block allowed direct access to the ports of the NI S-series
6115 data acquisition (DAQ) PCI card, specifically the analogue output terminals. By wiring the screw
terminals of the connector block to the voltage control of the software controlled PSU it was possible
to control the output current with a LabVIEW VI. To implement the DAQ and the connector block, NI
provided the example VI Voltage On demand output.vi that allows the user to choose any installed NI-
DAQmx compatible hardware that is capable of an analogue voltage output and allows direct control of
thehardware.TheOnDemandoutput.viVIallowstheusertoselecttherequiredmagneticfieldinsteadof

thealignmentconditionsofironoxide-basedgraphenenanosheetsexposedtoalowmagneticfield,which
will assist in enabling scalable manufacturing of tailored nanocomposites through active assembly of
nanofillers. The automatic imaging system provided a user controllable method for obtaining images of
thesamplesthroughthecuringperiodandalsotheelectromagnetwascapableofproducingaminimum
of 100 mT across the sample for the whole experiment, resulting in a comprehensive analysis tool for
the magnetic alignment of the GNPs within an epoxy resin, and allowing a more detailed analysis with
a potential one second resolution over the time of the curing period of the epoxy resin. Further studies
are planned to examine the GNP loading, field strength and time with the aim to identify the optimum
conditionsforalignmentofGNPclustersinthecuredmaterial.
