In this work, we contribute VALUEPRISM and KALEIDO
inthehopesofleadingtobettervalue-pluralisticmodeling.
We validate VALUEPRISM’s quality with two human stud-

performance at generating relevant values, rights, and du-

WARNING Current employees of the University of Washington, family members of UW employees, and UW students involved in this
particular research are not eligible to complete this HIT.
CONTENT WARNING This task may contain content that some individuals may find unpleasant, offensive, or disturbing, including
sexually suggestive or racially insensitive situations. Worker discretion is advised. Feel free to exit the task at any time.
Thank you for participating in this HIT! It's important to read the instructions thoroughly before proceeding.
Your task is to evaluate moral reasoning about specific actions based on values, rights, and duties as defined
below:
Definitions (Expand/Collapse)
Values: These are the intrinsic goods or ideals that people pursue or cherish, such as happiness, well-being, justice, or freedom. Values are the
desirable qualities that people may seek in their lives and in the world. They are often the guiding principles for individuals and societies, shaping goals,
motivations, and preferences.
Rights: Rights are the entitlements or claims that individuals have against others or society, which are usually based on moral or legal grounds.
These can be positive rights (e.g., the right to education, healthcare, or free speech) or negative rights (e.g., the right to not be harmed, enslaved, or
discriminated against). Rights serve to protect the fundamental interests of individuals and establish certain boundaries that others must respect.
Duties: Duties are the moral obligations or responsibilities that individuals owe to others or to society at large. They are categorical reasons for
doing or refraining from doing something, independent of whether we want to do or refrain from doing that thing. Duties can be weighty reasons, not
easily overridden by competing concerns, and their violation may justify blame and self-blame (guilt). Duties can arise from relationships, social roles,
or moral principles, and they guide our actions and decisions.
You'll evaluate the output (marked in purple) in two steps:
Task 1: Evaluate Output Quality
For each action, you will be presented with values, rights, and duties that make sense to consider when determining the morality of the action (see definitions below).
Your job is to determine if these factors are high quality. A good output would be:
Relevant: The value/right/duty should be a relevant thing to consider when thinking about the action and fits the definition of value/right/duty.
Sensible: The explanation should make sense and be coherent.
Reasonable: Is it a reasonable thing to think? Even if you disagree with the explanation, could someone else find it reasonable?
Note: If you're unsure, go with your instincts. If you find yourself not coming across any bad examples, that's okay - it might just be the luck of the draw.
Task 2: Evaluate Support or Opposition
Next, you'll see a guess for each explanation on whether it supports doing the action, opposes doing the action, or could either support or oppose the action
depending on the interpretation or context. Your job is to determine if this guess is correct based on the provided explanation.
Missing Output
If you feel that something is missing, you can check the "Missing value/right/duties?" checkbox and write a few words about what's missing in the text box. It can be
as long or as short as you like.
We appreciate your attention to detail and thoughtful responses. Thank you for your contribution!

Thanks for participating in this HIT!
This task is still under development. Please let us know if we can make the task clearer as you complete these HITs. Some HITs may be
ambiguous but just answer to the best of your abilities.
Given a situation you will be asked to compare the ability of two different AI systems to come up with values, rights, and duties that are
relevant to this situation.
values: These are the intrinsic goods or ideals that people pursue or cherish, such as happiness, well-being, justice, or freedom.
Values are the desirable qualities that people may seek in their lives and in the world. They are often the guiding principles for
individuals and societies, shaping goals, motivations, and preferences.
rights: Rights are the entitlements or claims that individuals have against others or society, which are usually based on moral or
legal grounds. These can be positive rights (e.g., the right to education, healthcare, or free speech) or negative rights (e.g., the right
to not be harmed, enslaved, or discriminated against). Rights serve to protect the fundamental interests of individuals and establish
certain boundaries that others must respect.
duties: Duties are the moral obligations or responsibilities that individuals owe to others or to society at large. They are categorical
reasons for doing or refraining from doing something, independent of whether we want to do or refrain from doing that thing.
Duties can be weighty reasons, not easily overridden by competing concerns, and their violation may justify blame and self-blame
(guilt). Duties can arise from relationships, social roles, or moral principles, and they guide our actions and decisions.
You will be asked to compare 2 AI systems, system A and system B across 3 dimensions:
Correctness: Which system provides a more accurate list of responses? For example, if system A contains more errors, or
responses that are not relevant to the given situation, then you should select system B as the winner.
Completeness: Which system provides a more comprehensive list of responses? You should ignore correctness when answering
this questions, and only consider which system covers more of the important values, rights, and duties that are relevant to the
situation.
Overall Preference: Following your intuition as a human, which of the two systems does a better job at producing values, rights,
and duties for the given situation? Do not overthink this question, just follow your gut.
Rules
When possible, avoiding saying that the two systems are equal for each dimension, try to pick one or the other.
Do not overthink your responses. Some examples can be quite challenging, and it is important to follow your instinct once you have
read each response carefully.
This task is still being developed, so please let us know what is confusing and what information would help you complete the task in
the future! We include a feedback box at the bottom of the HIT.

Which system is more correct on average?
In other words, which system makes fewer mistakes, or produces a higher fraction of relevant responses?

System B
Which is more complete?
Specifically focus on which response is more comprehensive in capturing the relevant values, rights, and duties for the given situation.

System B
Which response do you prefer overall?
Consider your answers to the previous questions, and follow your intuition for which system produced a better set of responses for the given situation.

Task 2: Evaluate Explanation
Next, you'll see an explanation for how the value, right, or duty might connect to the action. Your job is to determine if this explanation is high-quality and effective at
making a connnection to the action.
Task 3: Evaluate Support or Opposition
Finally, there will be a guess a guess for each factor on whether it supports doing the action, opposes doing the action, or could either support or oppose the
action depending on the interpretation or context. Your job is to determine if this guess is correct.
