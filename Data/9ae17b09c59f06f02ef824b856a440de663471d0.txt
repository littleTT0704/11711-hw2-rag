1 Overview of the competition
The Conversational Intelligence Challenge1 aims at finding approaches to creating high-
quality dialogue agents capable of meaningful open domain conversation. Today, the
progress in the field is significantly hampered by the absence of established benchmark
tasks for non-goal-oriented dialogue systems (chatbots) and solid evaluation criteria for
automatic assessment of dialogue quality. The aim of this competition was therefore to
establish a concrete scenario for testing chatbots that aim to engage humans, and become
a standard evaluation tool in order to make such systems directly comparable, including
open source datasets, evaluation code (both automatic evaluations and code to run the
human evaluation on Mechanical Turk), model baselines and the winning model itself.

This is the second Conversational Intelligence (ConvAI) Challenge; the previous one
was conducted under the scope of NeurIPS 2017 Competitions track. Taking into account
the results of the previous edition, this year we improved the task, the evaluation process,
and the human conversationalists’ experience. We did this in part by making the setup
simpler for the competitors, and in part by making the conversations more engaging for
humans. We provided a dataset from the beginning, Persona-Chat, whose training set
consists of conversations between crowdworkers who were randomly paired and asked to
act the part of a given provided persona (randomly assigned, and created by another set of
crowdworkers). The paired workers were asked to chat naturally and to get to know each
other during the conversation. This produces interesting and engaging conversations that
learning agents can try to mimic. The Persona-Chat dataset is designed to facilitate
research into alleviating some of the issues that traditional chit-chat models face, and with
the aim of making such models more consistent and engaging, by endowing them with a
persona [1]. Models are thus trained to both ask and answer questions about personal
topics, and the resulting dialogue can be used to build a model of the persona of the
speaking partner.
Competitors’ models were compared in three ways: (i) automatic evaluation metrics
on a new test set hidden from the competitors; (ii) evaluation on Amazon Mechanical
Turk; and (iii) ‘wild’ live evaluation by volunteers having conversations with the bots. We
declared winners in the automatic evaluation tracks, but the grand prize was awarded to
the best performing system in human evaluations.
The winner in the automatic evaluation tracks by a significant margin was the team
Hugging Face, however the grand prize winner from human evaluations was Lost in Con-
versation (Hugging Face coming in second place, with 23 entrants in total)2. There are a
number of key takeaways from our analysis of the results, indicating that the automatic
evaluations show some correlation to human evaluations, but fail to take into account im-
portant aspects of multi-turn conversation that humans consider important, in particular
the balance of dialogue acts throughout the conversation (e.g. the amount of questions
asked versus answered).
1.1 Previous competitions and task formulation
There have been a number of competitions on question answering (e.g. quiz bowl) which
can be seen as single-turn goal-directed dialogue, as well as competitions on goal-directed
dialogue involving dialogue state tracking (including 5 iterations of the DSTC challenge),
e.g. for booking restaurants or tourist information. Those do not explicitly address the
“chit-chat” setting of dialogue about general topics which is not goal-directed, although
later DSTC challenges do address chit-chat.

out intelligent and natural conversations about specific snippets from Wikipedia articles
with humans, which was not engaging to all human participants.
Ten dialogue systems participated in the 2017 competition. The majority of them com-
bined multiple conversational models such as question answering and chit-chat systems to
make conversations more natural. The evaluation of chatbots was performed by human as-
sessors. More than 1,500 volunteers were attracted and over 4,000 dialogues were collected
during the competition. All the data and the solutions of the winners are available via
the competition repo.3,4 The final score of the dialogue quality for the best bot was 2.746
compared to 3.8 for human. This demonstrates that current technology allows supporting
dialogue on a given topic but with quality significantly lower than that of humans.
In contrast to the first edition, the 2018 competition focused on general chit-chat about
people’s interests, rather than on encyclopedic facts. To our knowledge, no other com-
petition has focused on a dataset like this. Importantly, we provided a large training set
and validation set in a standard setup, complete with code for baseline systems for en-
trants to obtain clear automatic evaluation metrics to improve upon. In the 2017 ConvAI
competition, no data was initially provided but was instead collected by volunteers as the
competition progressed, which may have led to fewer participants.
Outside of NeurIPS, the most similar competition is probably the Alexa Prize5. This
is a competition to build a socialbot that can converse coherently and engagingly with
humans on popular topics for 20 minutes. The top bots were selected by Amazon Alexa
customers and the Amazon panel and competed head-to-head in front of three judges in
November 2017. Another small scale analogue is the Loebner Prize.6 Alexa Prize data and
models are not in the open domain, whereas our competition aims to have as deliverables
both data and winning models and training code. Further, unfortunately, the outcome
mostlyconfirmedthatensemblesareusefulinsuchtasksanddidlittletodrivefundamental
algorithm research.
The key differences from the the first (2017) ConvAI competition are the following:
• The conversations focused on engaging the interlocutors by discussing personal in-
terests (instead of encyclopedia articles they may not be interested in).
• A training set was provided at the start of the competition, making the competition
much more straightforward for participants.
• Evaluation included both automatic metrics, Amazon Mechanical Turk and ‘wild’
live volunteer conversations, making the evaluation much more complete.

2 Competition description and set-up
2.1 Data
The ConvAI2 dataset for training models is publicly available in ParlAI7, and is based on
the Persona-Chat dataset[1]. See Table 1 for an example dialogue. The speaker pairs
each have assigned profiles coming from a set of 1155 possible personas (at training time),
each consisting of at least 5 profile sentences, setting aside 100 never seen before personas
for validation. The dataset statistics are given in Table 2.
As the original Persona-Chat test set was released, we crowdsourced further data for
a hidden test set unseen by the competitors for automatic evaluation. The hidden test set
consisted of 100 new personas and over 1,015 dialogs.
To avoid modeling that takes advantage of trivial word overlap, additional rewritten
sets of the same train and test personas were crowdsourced, with related sentences that
arerephrases, generalizationsorspecializations, renderingthetaskmuchmorechallenging.
For example “I just got my nails done” is revised as “I love to pamper myself on a regular

basis” and “I am on a diet now” is revised as “I need to lose weight.”

The task aims to model normal conversation when two interlocutors first meet, and
get to know each other. Their aim is to be engaging, to learn about the other’s interests,
discuss their own interests and find common ground. The task is technically challenging
as it involves both asking and answering questions, and maintaining a consistent persona,
which is provided. Conversing with current chit-chat models for even a short amount of
timequicklyexposestheirweaknesses[2,3]. Commonissueswithchit-chatmodelsinclude:
(i) the lack of a consistent personality [4] as they are typically trained over many dialogues
each with different speakers, (ii) the lack of an explicit long-term memory as they are
typically trained to produce an utterance given only the recent dialogue history [3], and
(iii) a tendency to produce non-specific answers like “I don’t know” [5]. With this task we
aim to find models that address those specific issues [1].
Note that for training, competitors were allowed to use other additional training data
as long as it was made public (or was already public).
2.2 Metrics
We first evaluated all submissions on a set of automatic metrics. The top 7 teams from
the automatic metrics were then evaluated by humans:
• Automatic metrics - Perplexity, F1 and hits@1/20. These were computed on the
hidden test.
– Perplexity — a metric of text fluency which is computed as 1 (cid:80)m logp(w )
m i=1 i
for sentence w = w ,w ,...,w . This metric is computed only for probabilistic
1 2 m
generative models.
– F -score — 2· precision·recall . In the context of dialogue, precision is the fraction
1 precision+recall
of words in the predicted response that are contained in the gold response, and
recall is the fraction of words in the gold response that were in the predicted
response. This can be computed for any model, retrieval-based or generative.
– Hits@1/20 — hits@1/N is the accuracy of the next dialogue utterance when
choosing between the gold response and N −1 distractor responses (here, we
use N = 19). Distractor responses are random responses from the dataset. Any
model that can assign a score to a given candidate utterance can compute this
5
metric. Such a method could then in principle be used in a retrieval model to
score retrieved candidates.
• Human evaluations -
– Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: Giventheentrants’modelcode, weranliveex-
periments where Turkers chatted to a given model following instructions identi-
caltothecreationoftheoriginaldataset, butwithnewprofiles, andthenscored
its performance. Performance was evaluated by asking Turkers how much they
enjoyed talking to the model and having them verify which persona the model
was using given the choice between the correct persona and a random one.
– ‘Wild’ Live Chat with Volunteers: We solicited volunteers to chat to the
models in a similar way to the Mechanical Turk setup. This setup was hosted
through the Facebook Messenger and Telegram APIs.
2.3 Baselines and code available
Source code for baseline methods for the competition were provided in the open source
system ParlAI [6]8, including training loop and evaluation code. The example models are
the methods developed in [1], which we consider strong baselines. They include a retrieval-
based Key-Value Memory Network, and two generative models: an LSTM-based attentive
Seq2Seq model and a LSTM-based language model.
2.4 Rules
• Competitors must provide their source code so that the hidden test set evaluation
and live experiments can be computed without the team’s influence, and so that the
competition has further impact as those models can be released for future research
to build off them. Code can be in any language, but a thin python wrapper must be
provided in order to work with our evaluation and live experiment code via ParlAI’s
interface.
• Each team can only submit a maximum of once per month during the automatic
metrics round.
• We require that the winning systems also release their training code so that their
work is reproducible (although we also encourage that for all systems).
• Competitors should indicate which training sources are used to build their models,
and whether (and how) ensembling is used.
8https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/master/projects/convai2
6
• Competitors are free to augment training with other datasets as long as they are
publicly released (and hence, reproducible). Hence, all entrants are expected to work
on publicly available data or release the data they use to train.
2.5 Timeline
• April 21: Competition begins: automatic metrics leaderboard, baselines, and sub-
mission instructions are posted.
• May 9 Hackathon: We organized a non-compulsory hackathon around the competi-
tion: DeepHack.Chat. At the hackathon teams aimed to improve their systems, took
part in live human evaluations, and listened to lectures from researchers in the field.
• July 10: ‘Wild’ evaluation is open. Participants may submit their models to be
evaluated by live volunteers.
• September 30: Submissions for the automatic metrics round are closed. We invite
the top seven teams from this round to prepare their submissions for the Mechanical
Turk evaluation portion of the competition.
• December 9: Winner of the competition is announced at NeurIPS 2018.
2.6 Prize
The grand prize for the winner of the human evaluations was awarded $20,000 in funding
for Amazon Mechanical Turk, in order to encourage further data collection for dialogue
research. The winner in the automatic metrics received $5,000 in AWS compute.
3 Results and Analysis
3.1 Automatic Metrics
We had over 23 teams submit models to be evaluated for the automatic metrics. The rank
of each team was determined by sorting by the minimum rank of the score in any of the
three metrics (F1, Hits@1, and Perplexity). The Hugging Face team performed the best
in every single metric and was therefore determined to be the winner of this round. All
participants and their scores on the hidden test set are shown in Table 3.
Thetopseventeamsmadeittothenextround. Notably, eachoftheseteamssurpassed
our baseline models in some metric. The High Five team chose not to participate in the
human evaluation round, so ultimately six teams participated in the next round. Refer to
Section 4 for a description of the models submitted from the top-performing teams.

3.1.1 Further Analysis and Additional Automatic Metrics
Revised Personas We also evaluated models (from the teams in the top 7) that were
capable of ranking – i.e. models that were evaluated on the Hits@1 metric – on the
“revised”test set. Recallthatwecrowdsourced additional rewrittensetspersonas asaway
of measuring how much models rely on word overlap between utterances and personas for
their performance, as the revised ones have little or no overlap with the original personas.
The results are shown in Figure 1. The Hugging Face team performed the best on the
revised task, with Little Baby close behind. The performance of the baseline Key-Value
MemoryNetworkbaselinegreatlydeterioratedgiventherevisedpersonas. Hence,wefound
the success of the best competitor’s models as a good result, which we believe is due to
their use of sufficient pretraining and regularization, among other factors.

Last Utterance (Parrot) Distractor We also evaluated how adding a distractor can-
didateaffectedtheperformanceoftheserankingmodels. Namely,weaddedthelastpartner
message to the list of candidates to rank. A model should only in very rare circumstances
parrot the speaking partner, so the Hits@1 metric should remain at a similar score with
and without this distractor. See Figure 2 for the results. Most models suffered with this
metric, showing they probably rely too much on word overlap with the last utterance when
performing ranking (generally a response does have word overlap with the last utterance,
but still it should not be a copy – this makes this a somewhat difficult function for models
to learn). The Hugging Face model was the most resistant to this type of attack, but still
suffered to some degree.
3.1.2 F1 Metric Toy Baseline
Duringtheautomaticevaluationstageofthecompetition, wediscoveredthatalwaysreply-
ing with “i am you to do and your is like” would outperform the F1 score of all the models
in the competition. This toy baseline was constructed simply by picking several frequent
words from the training set. Specifically, always replying with this message gives an F1
score of 19.6 on the test set and 20.5 on the validation set (compare to Hugging Face’s
scores of 19.5 and 19.1 on the test and validation sets respectively). In [7], the authors
showed that word overlap metrics do not correlate well with human judgment for dialogue
response generation systems. This is another indication that we should reconsider using
F1 to evaluate our dialogue systems.

3.2 Human Evaluations
3.2.1 Wild Evaluation
Recall that we solicited volunteers to chat with and evaluate the top-performing models
through the Facebook Messenger and Telegram APIs. This setup is closer to real-world
chatbot applications than the Mechanical Turk evaluation set-up. As volunteers – unlike
Turkers–arenotpaidandthereforelesslikelytofollowtheinstructionsclosely,weexpected
the distribution of these results to be quite different than those from the Mechanical Turk
evaluation. Two notable (but expected) differences between the results of the Mechanical
Turkand“wild”evaluationsarethatthewildevaluationhadrelativelyfewergood(i.e. long
and consistent) dialogues, and Mechanical Turk workers tended to rate the models higher
than the volunteers in the wild evaluation. A detailed description of our “wild” dataset
and a comparison with the data from the first ConvAI competition will be described in
detail in separate publication9.
Given that many of the dialogues collected during the wild evaluation were either
senseless, offensive, or simply not in line with the instructions, and we did not have a
systematic way of distinguishing these from the “good dialogues, we decided to discount
the results from the wild evaluation altogether. See Table 4 for example conversations.
The data collected from this evaluation is available in the competition repo10. Detecting
this type of undesirable behavior remains an open (but we believe solvable) problem for

3.2.2 Mechanical Turk Evaluation
Sincetheresultsofthewildevaluationwereultimatelydiscounted,thewinnerofthehuman
evaluation round – and therefore the winner of the competition – was determined by per-
formance in the Mechanical Turk Evaluation. As announced at the NeurIPS Competition
Track Workshop, the Lost in Conversation team won the competition.
The set-up of the Mechanical Turk evaluation was nearly identical to the set-up we
used to collect the original Persona-Chat dataset. The chat interface is shown in Figure
3. For each evaluation, we paired a human worker with a model, assigned each of them
personas, andinstructedthehumanstochatwithandgettoknowtheirpartner. Dialogues
wereoflength4-6turnseach. Followingashortconversation,weaskedworkers“Howmuch
did you enjoy talking to this user?” and had them answer on a scale of 1-4. Additionally,
we tested whether the human could distinguish the persona the model was using from a
random one. We crowdsourced 100 evaluations for each model. Samples conversations
from some of the models are given in Appendix A.
The results are shown in Table 5. Lost in Conversation won the competition with
an engagingness score of 3.11 out of 4. We attempted to reduce annotator bias in the
engagingness scores by using a Bayesian calibration method recently proposed in [8]. The
results from before and after calibration are given in Figure 4. The calibration did not
affect the ordering of the scores, and the scores reported in the final leaderboard are post-
calibration.

3.2.3 Further Analysis of Results
Length Statistics In an attempt to understand the results from the Mechanical Turk
evaluations, we analyzed various word statistics on the conversation logs. We measured
the average length of both the bot and human responses for each team’s evaluation, as
shown in Table 6. Models with higher evaluation scores tended to get longer responses
from humans, which can be considered as an implicit engagement score. However, this
is possibly skewed by humans mimicking the length of the bot’s utterances, e.g. consider
ADAPT Centre’s results. We note that when humans are speaking with other humans,
theyhavemuchlongerutterancesonaveragethanthemodelsdo. Webelievethisisrelated
to their production of more generic, less engaging utterances.
Rare Word Statistics We also looked to see how often rare words were used in the
conversation logs. In Table 7, Freq1h and Freq1k indicate the frequency with which the
model used words that appear fewer than 100 or 1000 times in the training corpus. The
hypothesis here is that utterances with some rare words might be less generic and hence

more interesting/engaging, rendering higher human evaluation scores. The results show
that humans use significantly more rare words than any of the models, and the bottom
three models do have lower Freq1h scores than the top three; otherwise, however, the
relationship between evaluation score of the models and their use of rare words is not
completely clear. We suspect that is because this is just one factor among many that
would need to be disentangled.
Word and Utterance Repetition Statistics We then looked at how often the mod-
els repeated themselves in conversations with humans. Table 8 shows the frequency of
unigram, bigram, and trigram repeats in the model responses, as well as how often the
model’s responses were unique in the logs. Again, it is clear the humans repeat them-
selves very infrequently, but there is not a clear relationship between our proxy measures
of repetition with the human evaluation scores. We suspect this is because there are more
subtle instances of repeating that our proxies do not measure, and the proxies have already
been optimized by many models (e.g. by doing n-gram or full utterance blocking). For
example we observed instances like “i like watching horror” followed by “i love watching
scary movies” occurring, but these are not captured well by our metrics. Finally, overall
utterance uniqueness should ideally be close to 100% with the same utterance rarely being
repeated across conversations, with humans at 99%. While Hugging Face’s model was at
97%, many other models were lower, with the winner Lost in Conversation at 86%. A low
uniqueness score could be problematic for a deployed system, as it might make users tire
of it repeating itself. However, as our competition evaluations involve very short dialogues,
this likely did not impact human evaluations.
Blind Evaluation Following the above analyses, it was still unclear why the Lost in
Conversation model had a statistically significant human evaluation win over the Hugging
Face model, even though the Hugging Face model performed much better in the automatic
evaluations. To better understand this, we performed a blind evaluation ourselves of a

The average score given to this subset of conversations is shown in Table 9. As you can
see, despitetheapparentannotatorbias, eachannotatoragreedwiththeTurkersregarding
which model was better.
Asking questions Reading through the comments made by the blind annotators after-
wards, we noticed that while both models suffered from errors involving repetition, con-
sistency or being “boring”’ at times, a common complaint about the Hugging Face model
was that it “asked too many questions.” In order to determine to what extent this was
true, we analyzed the Mechanical Turk logs and measured how often each model response
began with a question word (like “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” or “how”) and
how often the response contained a question mark.
The results are given in Figure 5. It is clear that the Hugging Face model is indeed
a large outlier. Notably, you can see that in the 100 conversations it had, it began a
response with a question word 107 times whereas humans only did this 12 times. When
the model asks too many questions it can make the conversation feel disjointed, especially
if the questions do not relate to the previous conversation. Friendly chit-chat requires
a delicate balance of question-asking and question-answering. The tentative conclusion

Figure 5: How often did the models ask questions? We measured (on the left) how
often the models began their response with “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” or
“how,” as well as (on the right) how often the models’ responses contained at least one
question mark as an estimate for how often the models asked questions when conversing
with humans.
that we draw here is that the tendency to ask too many questions negatively affected the
human evaluation results for the Hugging Face model. Future work should consider how
we can automatically evaluate this type of conversation-level performance rather than just
utterance-level performance.
Persona Detection Lastly, looking at the persona detection scores from the Mechanical
TurkevaluationinTable5,wenotethatmostmodelsdidrelativelywellinthismetric(with
the exception of the Happy Minions model). Recall that this score is the percentage of the
time that the annotaters were able to to distinguish the model’s persona from a random
one. We often observed models repeating the persona sentences almost verbatim, which

to use the persona to create engaging responses rather than simply copying it remains an
open problem.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
Models The best models in the competition were variants of the generative Transformer
architecture. Those models have rather high capacity and thus cannot be trained on
ConvAI2 (Persona-Chat) data alone, but must be either pretrained or multitasked with
additionallargedatasets. Onecanusedialoguedatasetstopretrain,butitseemsasthough
thesystemstillworkswellwithlanguagemodelingdatasetsthatarenotexplicitlydialogue
(e.g. the Billion Words corpus). Many other tweaks to the base models were tried, such as
tryingtooptimize theautomaticmetrics directly, butwithout directablationswithhuman
evaluation it is difficult to state here the effects of all these components.
Retrieval models fared a little worse than generative models in the human evaluations,
although we are unsure if this is true in general, or because no very strong retrieval model
was proposed. With a Transformer-based retrieval model it is possible to get Hits@1 in
excess of 80% but no such method was tried by a competitor (see Table 3, Hugging Face
used a two-head Transformer model, but opted to generate rather than retrieve). In our
opinion, looking at the outputs from the generative systems in the competition, they still
fall short of the most interesting and engaging comments of humans (which sometimes
retrieval models choose); however, the generic responses from generative models are often
low-risk or “safe” responses, which may give them higher scores. A retrieve and refine
approach (combining generative and retrieval methods) is another possibility that was not
explored in the competition [10].
Finally, better sentence representations are being developed all the time. This compe-
tition was run before the BERT model [11] was released which has been shown to improve
many NLP tasks. Hence, we expect these models to improve on ConvAI2 as well.

Automatic vs. Human Evaluation It remains an open problem to find the best
automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue. There is not enough data from the competition
to measure correlation between the automatic metrics we tried and human evaluations in
depth. Clearlyarandomlyinitializedmodelhaspoorvaluesforallofthesemetrics,whereas
training to optimize any of them will improve human evaluations. The problem is more
whether the finer-grained differentiation of relatively similar models can be automatically
measured. We believe each automatic metric evaluates at least some aspects of what
humans consider a “good” model but misses other aspects. As such, optimizing only one
of these metrics can fail to address important issues. For example, optimizing per-word
perplexity fails to address the search strategy of a model when generating a full utterance,
e.g. it is not affected by beam search choices. Optimizing Hits@1 is a per-utterance metric
that fails to address the full conversational flow (as the gold dialogue history between two
humansisusedforthatmetric,notwhatthemodelpreviouslysaid). Somemodelsoptimize
F1 and do well, however it also has major issues (see Section 3.1.2). Further, it is very
hard to compare retrieval and generative models other than by human evaluation.
Nevertheless, we find the use of automatic metrics important for several reasons. If
we desire to be able to train our models offline at least initially (which we believe we do)
then we need an offline training objective, which typically relates to automatic metrics.
Hence, if we understand how human evaluations relate to automatic metrics, not only
will we understand the dialogue task better, but we will know how to perform such offline
training. Additionally, forourcompetitionitwouldhavebeenverydifficulttofiltermodels
for the human evaluation stage without the use of automatic metrics.
Towards Multi-turn Evaluation We thus believe we are still missing some key offline
(automatic) metrics, but have hope that they are possible to find. We identified that the
current metrics fail to measure the multi-turn aspects of human evaluation, in particular in
terms of repetition, consistency and balance of dialogue acts. Even the best competitors’
models often failed to be self-consistent across a few dialogue turns, which we believe
was at least partly responsible for lowering their evaluation score. For example, “i am a
professional runner. you? i love running” followed by “i’m not very athletic” or “i work
as a snowboard instructor” followed by “i work for a food company” are both unlikely
continuations of a conversation. Even if they happen infrequently, these problems are
particularly jarring for a human speaking partner when they do happen.
In a related problem, we observed the models asking questions that are already an-
swered, e.g. one model asks “what do you do for a living?” even though the human earlier
stated “i work on computers” resulting in the human replying “I just told you silly”.
Onepossiblesolutiontotheseproblemsistheuseofdialoguenaturallanguageinference
(NLI) [12], a new task that has been proposed that evaluates exactly these problems. It
works by providing pairs of utterances as input, and the task is then to predict if the pair
entail, are neutral or contradict. This is exciting because it can allow us to both (i) fix our
model’s consistency problems by training on this new task and (ii) evaluate to what extent
18
our model’s consistency problems are fixed using the evaluation set.
Finally, in Section 3.2.3 we identified that models that do not balance question asking
with answering over multiple turns might can cause human evaluations to suffer. Given
this information, it may be possible to construct new metrics that measure these kind of
balances so that we can optimize them (to look more similar to human data, for instance).
Towards more complex tasks Going forward, even if we can completely solve the
ConvAI2 Persona-Chat task (i.e. reach human performance), it is still only a meet-
and-greet task involving getting to know someone for a few dialogue turns, with shallow
topics and quick context switches. Clearly many aspects of an intelligent agent are not
evaluated by this task, such as the use of long-term memory or in-depth knowledge and
deeper reasoning. For example, in Table 1 “Game of Thrones” is mentioned, but a model
imitating this conversation would not really be required to know anything more about
the show, as in ConvAI2 speakers tend to shallowly discuss each other’s interest without
lingering on a topic for too long. Subsequent competitions could explore this issue further.
Such a study is feasible as several new datasets are being released to explore such a setting,
in particular the Wizard of Wikipedia task involves using knowledge from Wikipedia to
discuss open-domain topics [13]. The DSTC7 competition13 also recently addressed this
topic, however the evaluation was not multi-turn.
