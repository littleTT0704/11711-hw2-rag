Abstract
During comprehension, the meaning extracted from serial language input
can be described by hierarchical phrase structure. Whether our brains ex-
plicitly encode hierarchical structure during processing is, however, debated.
In this study we recorded Magnetoencephalography (MEG) during reading
of structurally ambiguous sentences to probe neural activity for representa-
tions of underlying phrase structure. 10 human subjects were presented with
simple sentences, each containing a prepositional phrase that was ambiguous
with respect to its attachment site. Disambiguation was possible based on
semantic information. We applied multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to
the MEG data using linear classifiers as well as representational similarity
analysis to probe various effects of phrase structure building on the neu-
ral signal. Using MVPA techniques we successfully decoded both syntactic
(part-of-speech) as well as semantic information from the brain signal. Im-
portantly, however, we did not find any patterns in the neural signal that
differentiate between different hierarchical structures. Nor did we find neural
tracesofsyntacticorsemanticreactivationfollowingdisambiguatingsentence
material. These null findings suggest that subjects may not have processed
the sentences with respect to their underlying phrase structure. We discuss
methodological limits of our analysis as well as cognitive theories of ”shallow
processing”, i.e. in how far rich semantic information can prevent thorough
syntactic analysis during processing.

1. Introduction
1
Although we perceive language mainly in a sequential fashion (e.g. by
2
reading word by word) we need to take into account information beyond
3
the sequential order to fully comprehend its meaning. For example, in a
4
sentence like “The woman who owns two dogs chases the cat” we understand
5
that the woman is the one chasing, not the dog. This knowledge can be
6
expressed through hierarchical, structured relationships between the words.
7
Specifically, words can be grouped into constituents (e.g. “Who owns the
8
dog”and“Thewomanchasesthecat”)andconstituentsinturncanbenested
9
intohigher-levelphrases,asshownin1. Theresultingnestedphrasestructure
10
then fully describes the important conceptual units and their relationships
11
with each other. Thus, hierarchical phrase structure also directly relates to
12
thematic role assignment (the woman being assigned the agent role of the
13
chasing action).

As seen above, syntactic aspects like word order, function words (here: the
17
relative pronoun ‘who’) as well as morpho-syntactic features such as number
18
agreement provide cues with respect to the word-phrase relationships. Se-
19
mantic information (e.g. animacy) or even just semantic association itself can
20
also guide how structure should be assigned. In the above example, syntac-
21
tic cues, however, override simple semantic association between the lemmas

“dog” and “chase”. In theory, hierarchical descriptions can be applied to all
23
linguistic levels of the stimulus during language processing (e.g. syntactic,
24
semantic and phonological structure) (Jackendoff [2003]).
25
How hierarchical phrase structure building is neurally encoded as we pro-
26
cess language is still an open question. In fact, some have even disputed its
27
neural and psychological reality during language use altogether (Frank et al.
28
[2012]). Some recent evidence for the reality of hierarchical phrase struc-
29
ture building comes from neuroimaging studies that assess its consequences
30
on memory load (Nelson et al. [2017]; Pallier et al. [2011]) and production
31
(Giglio et al. (in prep)). For example, Pallier et al. varied linguistic con-
32
stituent size while keeping overall sentence length constant and identified
33
brainregionswhoseactivityparametricallyincreasedwiththesizeofthecon-
34
stituents (larger constituents thought to result in higher memory demands
35
and stronger neural activity) (Pallier et al. [2011]). Following a similar ap-
36
proach, Nelson et al. modelled neural activity according to a hierarchical
37
phrase-structure model and found it to explain more variance when fitted to
38
intracranial data as compared to alternative models that were based on tran-
39
sition probabilities only (Nelson et al. [2017]). This is in line with behavioral
40
evidence,demonstratingthathumanspreferahierarchicalinterpretationover
41
a linear one, for example when interpreting ambiguous noun phrases, such
42
as “second blue ball” (Coopmans et al. [2021]). At the same time, there
43
are several studies demonstrating that reading times can often be sufficiently
44
accounted for by sequential-structure models (Frank and Bod [2011]), cast-
45
ing doubt on how pervasive the construction of hierarchical structure during
46
language processing really is.

In early psycholinguistic experiments, hierarchical structure building has
48
been measured through reading time behaviour for structurally ambiguous
49
sentences. One example for such ambiguity is prepositional phrase attach-
50
ment. Prepositional phrases (PPs) in sentence-final position (examples 2 &
51
3) are structurally ambiguous with respect to their attachment to the main
52
clause. For example, a prepositional phrase can be interpreted as noun-
53
attached as in sentence 2 (a cop with the revolver) or as verb-attached as
54
in sentence 3, in which case it modifies the verb (seeing with binoculars).
55
In contrast to other structurally ambiguous stimuli such as garden-path sen-
56
tences, different prepositional phrase attachments do not involve different
57
word forms or function words. Hence, any disambiguation cannot depend
58
on syntactic information. Still, human readers are able to assign a unique
59
meaningtosuchstructurallyambiguoussentenceswithease, relyingonworld
60
knowledge to connect the semantic information provided by both the prepo-
61
sitional phrase itself with its preceding context in the most plausible way
62
(e.g. revolvers are likely to be carried by cops and binoculars are likely in-
63
struments for seeing.). Note that sentence-final prepositional phrases are not
64
rare or non-canonical. For example, in the structurally annotated TIGER
65
corpus (see methods for details) we found about 43% of all prepositional
66
phrases to be structurally ambiguous.

Originally, structurally ambiguous sentences had been shown to lead to
70
prolonged reading times at the disambiguating word (e.g. noun-attached PPs
71
being read more slowly than verb-attached PPs). Based on these findings,

Frazier had proposed sentence comprehension to rely on an initial structural
73
interpretation of the sentence driven by syntactic cues only and following
74
certain rules such as the minimal attachment principle. According to the
75
minimal attachment principle, the preferred structure is always the more
76
shallow one (i.e. the one resulting in a minimal amount of nested dependen-
77
cies). Therefore, according to minimal attachment the verb-attached reading
78
of the PP is preferred already when encountering the preposition. In the case
79
of a noun-attached phrase, subsequent words thus leads to the need for post-
80
hoc structural reanalysis and as a consequence longer reading times (Rayner
81
et al. [1983]; Frazier and Rayner [1982]). Frazier’s early theory was quickly

and Sedivy [1995]),(Altmann and Steedman [1988]),(Taraban and McClel-
87
land [1988]),(Traxler and Tooley [2007]),(Mohamed and Clifton [2011]). For
88
the processing of ambiguous PPs, it has been shown that facilitated pro-
89
cessing of verb-attachments is modulated by referential information imposed
90
by the context (Altmann and Steedman [1988]) as well as semantic con-
91
tent of the preceding verb (Spivey-Knowlton and Sedivy [1995]). More con-
92
cretely, Spivey-Knowlton et al. have shown that action verbs bias expecta-
93
tions towards verb-attachment while verbs referring to mental states (e.g. the
94
spy hoped for ..) or perception can bias towards noun-attachment (Spivey-
95
Knowlton and Sedivy [1995]). The authors explain this by different types of

tion verbs occur with an instrument more often than perception verbs). As a
98
consequence, readingtimedifferencesthathaveoriginallybeeninterpretedto
99
be a direct consequence of hierarchical structure building, could be reflecting
100
predictions about upcoming semantic content instead.
101
In a more recent study, Boudewyn and colleagues argued against this
102
alternative hypothesis of PP reading differences being caused by varying se-
103
mantic predictions. They investigated the neural activity evoked by verb-
104
and noun-attached prepositional phrases through event-related potentials
105
(ERPs). In addition to the classically observed delay in reading times, their
106
noun-attachedstimulievokedlargerpositivepotentialsaround600ms(P600)
107
(ascomparedtotheirverb-attachedversions). Importantly,theyshowedthat
108
the amplitude of this P600 was reduced when noun-attached targets followed
109
noun-attached primes (Boudewyn et al. [2014]). Boudewyn and colleagues
110
are not the first ones to report structural priming effects. In fact, syntactic
111
priming has been reported already some 35 years ago, showing that speak-
112
ers are more likely to repeat a given syntactic structure in their utterances
113
than to switch between two conceptually equal alternatives (Bock [1986]).
114
To evoke priming of hierarchical structure, researchers explicitly vary lexical
115
information while keeping syntactic structure stable. More recent investiga-
116
tions indicate, however, that event structure (i.e. thematic roles) as well as
117
lexical information can to a large degree account for many priming results
118
and hence priming solely on the structural level has not been definitively
119
proven yet (Ziegler et al. [2019]). Other confounding factors that can evoke
120
priming and are often contrasted along side syntactic structures are informa-
121
tion structure, syntax-animacy mapping and rhythmic priming. Boudewyn

et al. argue for their priming effect to be structural in nature based on the
123
timing of their observed ERP effect. Differences in ERPs have been gener-
124
ally interpreted as neural markers for a difference in processing (for example
125
more or less engagement of the underlying neuronal population). The P600,
126
specifically, has been reported most often in the context of syntactic viola-
127
tions or anomalies. Hence, the authors interpret this priming effect to reflect
128
facilitated structural processing of an originally dis-preferred structure. Still,
129
ERP effects need to be interpreted with caution, since their relationship to
130
underlying cognitive mechanisms is unclear. For example, recent computa-
131
tional cognitive models of language processing illustrate that ERP markers
132
canbemodelledasreflectinggeneralupdateorerrorsignals, withoutrestrict-
133
ing them to any specific linguistic operation (Rabovsky et al. [2018]),(Fitz
134
and Chang [2018]).
135
In addition, most ERP research so far reflects only a one-sided mea-
136
sure of the neural code. Namely, the dominant analysis approach has been
137
to treat ERPs as unidimensional point-estimates. Computing signal ampli-
138
tude separately for a given channel and time point and averaged over trials,
139
subjects and eventually space and time. As a consequence, such analyses
140
can only detect univariate effects and are highly sensitive to subject-level
141
variability. With the recent increase in computing power and developments
142
of multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) we can now capture richer mul-
143
tidimensional information encoded across several channels or source points
144
(Guggenmosetal.[2018]; Normanetal.[2006]). ThroughMVPA,researchers
145
have been able to uncover additional task-relevant brain regions (Jimura and

biguity resolution in more detail (Tyler et al. [2013]). Furthermore, MVPA
148
has the potential to be sensitive to distributed neural representations of the
149
content whereas univariate methods have been thought to be most sensi-
150
tive to the engagement of basic processing operations (Raizada et al. [2010],
151
Mur et al. [2009], Okada et al. [2010]). Although not every effect revealed
152
through MVPA is necessarily indicative of an underlying distributed neural
153
code (Davis et al. [2014]), the technique has nonetheless been successfully
154
used to reveal higher-level structure in the neural signal for domains other
155
than language (e.g. for hierarchical motor sequences Yokoi and Diedrichsen
156
[2019]). MVPA might hence be better suited to target hierarchical structure
157
building during language processing than previous univariate methods.
158
In this study, we revisit processing of structurally ambiguous PPs with
159
the approach of MVPA in order to more directly tap into representations
160
of hierarchical structure underlying language comprehension. In contrast
161
to early psycholinguistic approaches we do not assume that noun or verb-
162
attached prepositional phrases are processed differently from each other in
163
the sense of one structure being more preferred over another. Rather we ask,
164
whether it is possible to find a neural correlate of the hierarchical phrase
165
structure of a sentence (i.e. neural patterns that distinguish between verb-
166
and noun-attached PPs), given completely ambiguous syntactic cues.

2.1. Stimulus Material
169
2.1.1. Corpus Analysis
170
All stimuli were created in German. Since most of the previous liter-
171
ature had looked at prepositional phrases in English, we first conducted a
172
corpus analysis to determine which German preposition will most likely be
173
ambiguous with respect to structural attachment of the prepositional phrase.
174
ForourcorpusanalysisweusedtheTIGERcorpus, amanuallyannotated
175
corpus of 40,000 German sentences (Brants et al. [2004]). The corpus is
176
available at www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de in both xml as well as conll09 format.
177
We used the xml version for queries with the TIGERSearch Tool as well
178
as the conll09 version for quick extraction of frequency statistics using the
179
bash shell command awk. We extracted separate frequency information per
180
preposition and structure (noun-attached and verb-attached prepositional
181
phrases) through the TIGERSearch software (see Appendix for details on
182
the TIGERSearch queries).
183
2.1.2. Stimuli
184
Based on the corpus search, we selected the preposition “mit” (engl.:
185
with) because it occurs with high frequency (Figure 1) and equally often
186
within both noun- and verb attached phrases (Figure 2). We created a stim-
187
ulus set of 100 sentence pairs in German. All sentences consisted of nine
188
words each, a subject-verb-object structure in the main clause followed by a
189
four word prepositional phrase including the preposition and a determiner-
190
adjective-noun phrase. This sentence structure was syntactically ambiguous

with respect to the attachment site of the prepositional phrase. Within a
192
given pair, the same prepositional phrase was presented while the sentence
193
context leading up to it was manipulated. Based on the combined semantic
194
information of the sentence context and the prepositional phrase, the in-
195
terpretation of the most plausible attachment could be disambiguated. To
196
steer the preferred attachment interpretation, we manipulated the sentence
197
context in two ways. In half of the sentence pairs we varied the main verb,
198
we call this the verb condition (examples 4 & 5). Sentence pairs in the verb
199
conditionwereconstructedsuchthatthenouninobjectpositioncouldpoten-
200
tially be modified by the PP but did not have a particularly strong semantic
201
association with the PP internal noun. By presenting these sentences with a
202
verb for which modification through the PP internal noun was either allowed
203
or forbidden (or atleast unlikely), a verb-attached interpretation couldeither
204
be encouraged or prevented respectively. In the other half of the sentence
205
pairs, we exchanged agent and patient identity across the two sentences. In
206
the following, I will refer to this as the role condition (examples 6 & 7). For
207
sentence pairs in the role condition the two nouns preceding the PP had a
208
varying degree of semantic association to the PP internal noun while the verb
209
was held stable with a mild semantic association to the PP internal noun and
210
optional modification through a PP. This lead to a noun-attached interpre-
211
tation if the more strongly associated noun occurred in object position (the
212
noun immediately preceding the PP) but to a verb-attached interpretation
213
when it occurred in subject position. In both the role and the verb con-
214
dition, each verb was repeated exactly two times across all sentences. We
215
explore difference between verb and role conditions in the behavioral data

For the majority of the sentences, the overall semantics licensed both PP
230
attachments, even if they were constructed such that one attachment should
231
be perceived as more plausible. To verify that our manipulation evoked
232
the intended sentence interpretation we pre-tested all stimuli via an online
233
questionnaire, created with the survey tool Limesurvey (Carsten Schmitz
234
[2012]). During this online questionnaire, 62 native German speakers with a
235
mean age of 25 (range 19-33) judged for each stimulus-sentence whether it
236
contained a verb- or noun-attached prepositional phrase and how plausible
237
they found the sentence (on a scale from 1 to 5). All subjects gave informed
238
consent prior to filling in the survey and received financial reimbursement.

Based on the answers we selected 200 sentences out of a larger set of 469
240
sentences according to criteria described in detail below (see Table 2 and 3 in
241
AppendixforthefinalselectionofsentencesasusedintheMEGexperiment).
242
First, subjects were instructed about the difference in attachments. This
243
was done using unambiguous stimuli and a non-formal intuitive explanation
244
like“Intheverb-attachedcasetheprepositionalphrasesayssomethingabout
245
the verb”. Subjects were then asked to formulate the rule to distinguish the
246
two attachments in their own words and were presented with four unam-
247
biguous practice items. Finally, they would read 80 to 100 sentences one by
248
one and for each sentence decide between verb- or noun attachment. Ten
249
seconds after a sentence appeared on screen a pop-up window encouraged
250
subjects to answer faster. This time limit was chosen to force subjects to
251
answer intuitively. However, many subjects would need more time on certain
252
trials. After selecting their answer they could continue with the next item
253
at their own pace. Half way through the questionnaire subjects were encour-
254
aged to take a longer break if needed. The stimulus list was split up into
255
three parts to keep the duration of each survey to about 30 minutes. Each
256
subject saw one of the possible lists in a pseudo-random order, so that sen-
257
tences from the same pair were at least four items apart. Three subjects were
258
excluded either based on poor performance on the practice items (less than
259
three correct), because their average reaction time diverged extremely from
260
the average (greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range) or because they
261
had less than 60% correct answers to those sentences that were semantically
262
completely unambiguous.

were selected if both received at least 74% of answers consistent with the
266
intended attachment. With more than 74% of answers being consistent with

samples per item. The selection was made so that every verb was repeated
270
exactly two times and there were equal amounts of sentences in both verb
271
and role condition.
272
On pre-test results for the final selection of sentences, we used a gener-
273
alised linear mixed effects model (GLMM) with a logit link function fit by
274
maximum likelihood to examine the relationship between accuracy (i.e. per-
275
centage of answers in line with our expectations), reaction time, plausibility
276
ratings(onascaleof1to5),contextmanipulation(verbconditionorrolecon-
277
dition) and attachment type (verb- or noun-attached). A mixed logit model
278
appropriately accounts for binomial response variables (Jaeger [2008]), in our
279
casehitsormisses(correctlyidentifyinganattachmentaccordingtointended
280
sentence meaning or not). The model thus allowed us to test whether there
281
were systematic differences in processing noun- or verb-attached sentences,
282
as well as systematic differences between our different context manipulation
283
conditions while controlling for between-subject variance. We specified ac-
284
curacy (hit or miss) as the dependent variable and reaction time, plausibility
285
rating, and context condition as fixed effects. Additionally, the model in-
286
cluded random-effect terms for items (intercept only) and subject (intercept
287
and slope). The model was fully saturated with all two-way interaction ef-
288
fects.

GLMM results indicate a significant effect of attachment type and plau-
290
sibility, with factor level contrasts revealing that subjects were more often
291
correct for noun-attached items (see Figure 3) and high plausibility ratings
292
led to high accuracy. There was a significant Attachment type x Plausibility
293
interaction. Factor level contrasts revealed that the effect of high plausibil-
294
ity leading to high accuracy was stronger for verb-attached sentences than
295
noun-attached sentences (see Figure 4). The context manipulation effect was
296
not significant and only the interaction Context Manipulation x Attachment
297
was significant, indicating that only for noun-attached sentences were items
298
more often correctly interpreted in the verb condition compared to the role
299
condition (see Figure 3). Finally, the interaction of Reaction Time x Plau-
300
sibility was significant. As illustrated in Figure 5, high plausibility ratings

2.2. Experiment
309
10 Native German speakers (mean age = 22 years, 3 male) were seated in
310
a magnetically shielded room and read sentences word-by-word while their
311

312

reimbursement or credits. All stimuli were presented using the Presentation
314
software (Version 16.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc). Sentences were pre-
315
sented in pseudo-random order and word-by-word in four blocks with self-
316
pacedpausesinbetweenblocks. In25%ofalltrialsacomprehensionquestion
317
would follow the sentence. Comprehension questions were either directed at
318
identifying the agent or patient of the sentence (“Who has the bucket” or
319
“Who is being carried”) or they would target the semantic dependency of
320
the prepositional attachment (example question following (1): “Who has the
321
questionable arguments”). The question was presented together with two
322
answers, one on the left and one on the right side of the screen. Subjects
323
indicated which answer they chose by pressing a button with their index
324
finger corresponding to the position of the answer on the screen. The com-
325
prehension questions were meant to ensure that subjects were engaged and
326
attentive during the task and that they fully parsed the presented sentences
327
on both a semantic as well as structural level. Prior to the main experiment
328
subjects received four practice trials to familiarise themselves with the pace
329
of the presentation. Words were presented sequentially on a back-projection
330
screen, placed in front of them (vertical refresh rate of 60 Hz) at the centre
331
of the screen, in a white font, on a black background. Each word was sepa-
332
rated by an empty screen for 200 ms and the final word of each sentence was

followed by a 2000 ms blank screen. Duration of each word on screen was
334
392 ms on average and varied with word length with a minimum duration
335
of 300 ms and maximum duration of 500 ms (formula: 300 ms + number of
336
letters * 1000/60). The inter-sentence interval was jittered between 500 and
337
1000 ms. Within two weeks after the MEG experiment, subjects filled out a
338
questionnaire rating each stimulus sentence as either noun- or verb attached
339
and as plausible on a scale from 1 to 5. This questionnaire was the same as
340
the one used for the pre-test but contained only those stimuli that had been
341
used during the MEG experiment.

MEGdatawerecollectedwitha275axialgradiometersystem(CTF).The
343
signalswereanaloglow-pass-filteredat300Hzanddigitizedatasamplingfre-

quency of 1,200 Hz. The position of the subject’s head was registered to the
345
MEG-sensor array using three coils attached to the subject’s head (nasion,
346
and left and right ear canals). Throughout the measurement, the head posi-
347
tion was continuously monitored using custom software (Stolk et al. [2013]).
348
During breaks the subject was instructed to reposition to the original posi-
349
tion if needed. Subjects were able to maintain a head position within 5 mm
350
of their original position. Three bipolar Ag/AgCl electrode pairs were used
351
to measure the horizontal and vertical electrooculogram and the electrocar-
352
diogram. In addition to the brain signal, we acquired T1-weighted magnetic
353
resonance (MR) images of each subject’s brain using 3 Tesla Siemens Pris-
354
maFit and Skyra scanners. All scans covered the entire brain and had a voxel
355
size of 1x1x1mmˆ3. Finally, we recorded the subject’s head shape with the
356
Polhemus for better co-registration of MEG and anatomical scans.

2.3. Preprocessing & Source reconstruction
358
Data were pre-processed using the Fieldtrip toolbox in MATLAB (Oost-
359
enveld et al. [2011]). For the decoding analysis the Donders machine learning
360
toolbox (Van Gerven et al. [2013]) was used in combination with custom-
361
made MATLAB scripts. The data were segmented into epochs around word
362
onset with a 200 ms pre-stimulus period. To detect muscle artifacts, data
363
was bandpass filtered between 110 Hz and 140 Hz and the trials with large
364
variance were excluded upon inspection (less than 4% of all critical trials).
365
Data was filtered between 0.1 Hz and 40 Hz. Independent component analy-
366
sis (ICA) was used to remove artifacts stemming from the cardiac signal and
367
eye blinks. For each subject, the time course of the independent components
368
was correlated with the horizontal and vertical EOG signals as well as the
369
ECG signal to identify and subsequently remove contaminating components.
370
We used linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming (LCMV)
371
(Van Veen et al. [1997]) to reconstruct activity onto a parcellated cortically
372
constrained source model. For this, we computed the covariance matrix
373
between all MEG-sensor pairs as the average covariance matrix across the
374
cleaned single trial covariance estimates. This covariance matrix was used
375
in combination with the forward model, defined on a set of 7842 source lo-
376
cations per hemisphere on the subject-specific reconstruction of the cortical
377
sheet to generate a set of spatial filters, one filter per dipole location. In-
378
dividual cortical sheets were generated with the Freesurfer package (Dale
379
et al. [1999],version 5.1) (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). The forward model
380
was computed using FieldTrip’s singleshell method (Nolte [2003]), where the
381
required brain/skull boundary was obtained from the subject-specific T1-

weighted anatomical images. We further reduced the dimensionality of the
383
data, by grouping source points into 374 parcels, using a refined version of
384
the Conte69 atlas. These parcels were used as searchlights in the subsequent
385
analyses.

2.4. Multivariate decoding analysis
387
2.4.1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
388
We trained a Gaussian Na¨ıve Bayes classifier (GNB) (Mitchell [1997]) to
389
identify cognitive states associated with underlying sentence structure from
390
the pattern of brain activity evoked by reading the final word of a prepo-
391
sitional phrase. The GNB is a generative classifier that models the condi-
392
tional probability P(x |Y ) of signal amplitude x (at a given sensor/voxel j)
393 j i
given that the stimulus is of a class Y (noun- or verb-attached prepositional
394 i
phrase) using a univariate Gaussian and assuming class conditional indepen-
395
dence. The mean and variance of this distribution is estimated on a subset
396
of the trials (training set). The remaining data (test set) is then classified as
397
the class Y whose posterior probability P(Y |x) is maximal among all classes.

Classificationresultswereevaluatedusing20-foldcross-validation, sothat
401
accuracy was always based on test data that were disjoint from the training
402
set. 20 folds were chosen for a good balance between amount of training data
403
per fold and computational speed. Accuracy was estimated as the percentage
404
of correctly classified trials across all folds. Classifiers were trained using a
405
sliding time-window approach, where for each time-point, MEG data from

all sensors and all time-points +-50ms were concatenated into a single vector
407
(length = vertices x time-points). We also trained the same classifier on
408
source-reconstructed data using a spatial searchlight approach in addition to
409
the sliding time-window. The searchlight procedure followed the parcellation
410
of the cortical sheet. For each parcel and time-point a classifier was trained
411
on source data of all vertices within that parcel, while concatenating across
412
all time-points within a sliding window of width 100 ms.
413
All parameters chosen for the classification analysis were manually op-
414
timised based on accuracy of an orthogonal classification task, namely to
415
distinguishneuralpatternsevokedbyeitherreadingthemainverborthesec-
416
ond noun (object noun) of the sentences. Decoding which of these different
417
word classes was being presented robustly resulted in accuracies significantly
418
higher than chance performance. Within our stimulus design, word class
419
was confounded with ordinal word position in the sentences. Therefore, we
420
conducted a control analysis on the same ordinal word positions within only
421
filler items (where sentence structure varied and therefore nouns and verbs
422
did not always occur at the same sentence position). This control analysis
423
did not yield comparably high decoding accuracies. We compared the perfor-
424
mance of the verb-noun classifier given different sliding time window widths
425
(50 ms, 100 ms or 200 ms) and feature transformations (concatenating vs av-
426
eraging over time dimension, feature selection, orthogonalisation and feature
427
reduction through principal component analysis (PCA), gaussianisation).

PCA transforms the data into linearly uncorrelated components, ordered
429
by the amount of variance explained by each component. Using these un-
430

classifiers such as GNB, which assume no feature covariance (Grootswagers
432
et al. [2017]). Furthermore, PCA allowed our feature selection to be based on
433
a data-driven approach by keeping only a subset of components that explain
434
highest variance. We observed that both orthogonalising of features (sensor-
435
time points) using PCA and feature reduction by restricting training to the
436
first 60 components only, boosted classification accuracy. Further feature se-
437
lection based on signal strength (selecting features based on largest difference
438
in means between classes) did not improve accuracy beyond the the effects
439
of feature reduction based on PCA. Gaussianisation of the sensor-level data
440
prior to classification analysis or broadening the training time window did
441
not yield large differences in performance. Based on these comparisons we
442
then continued to train the classifier on the noun- vs. verb-attachments with
443
the optimal parameters.
444
2.4.2. Representational similarity analysis
445
Prepositional phrase attachment is interpreted based on the semantic in-
446
formation given the context preceding the phrase. We therefore predicted
447
that there might be reactivation of this semantic information (i.e. those se-
448
mantic features that most strongly influence the attachment) after the dis-
449
ambiguating sentence-final word. We tested this hypothesis through rep-
450
resentational similarity analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al. [2008]), repre-
451
senting semantic content by means of a high-dimensional word-embedding
452
vector (semantic vectors). For the word-embeddings we relied on pre-trained
453
24

models published by facebookresearch1 which had been trained on German
454
Wikipedia using fastText (Bojanowski et al. [2016]; Grave et al. [2018]).
455
First, we ensured that the semantic information captured by the word-
456
embeddings is also encoded in the neural signal. We extracted all segments
457
of neural data time-locked to each word presented and further restricted the
458
selection to either content words only for this analysis or sentence-final words
459
(as described in detail below). We then generated pairwise similarity mea-
460
sures between those words by computing the euclidean distance between
461
their corresponding word-embedding vectors (semantic similarity model).
462
Repeated presentations of the same word were treated as separate words
463
(i.e. not averaged across). In the same way, we computed pairwise similarity
464
measures for the corresponding segments in the neural signal, i.e. the pair-
465
wise neural similarity during reading of the same words. Words that were not
466
present in the vocabulary of the pre-trained embeddings were excluded from
467
both semantic model and neural data, which left 387 trials in total. Neural
468
similarity was computed based on a moving searchlight by concatenating all
469
samples within a 100 ms time-window and across source locations within a
470
given parcel, and this was repeated for all parcels and shifting time-windows
471
(between word onset and 800 ms post onset) with an 80% overlap in time.
472
Finally, semantic similarity and neural similarity were correlated (Spearman
473
correlation) at each searchlight position. This resulted in a map indicating
474
when and where neural activity reflected semantic information about the
475
perceived words.

Crucially, we then generalised this RSA to the post-sentence phase, when
477
subjectswerereadingthefinal,disambiguatingword. Forthis,were-computed
478
the neural similarity, this time based on neural activity evoked by the final
479
word. For each Verb-attached and each Noun-attached PP instead of the
480
word-embedding of the final noun we assign the word-embedding vector of
481
the preceding verb or noun respectively (i.e. of the most plausible attach-
482
ment points). We then recomputed the euclidean distance between word-
483
embedding vectors for all trial pairs, which now expresses for each sentence
484
pair the semantics similarity with respect to the disambiguated attachment
485
sites. Any significant correlations between the neural similarity and the at-
486
tachment site semantic similarity indicate when and where neural patterns
487
evoked by reading the final noun are also encoding (i.e. reactivate) informa-
488
tion about the preceding verb or noun respectively.
489
2.5. Significance testing of decoding accuracy
490
When evaluating significance of group-level accuracy differences between
491
two classifiers (GNB vs. logistic regression; part-of-speech classifier vs. word
492
position control) we relied on non-parametric permutation testing (Maris
493
and Oostenveld [2007]), randomly swapping observed accuracy between clas-
494
sifiers. For statistical evaluation of the GNB classifier against chance level
495
we relied on information prevalence inference (Allefeld et al. [2016]) based
496
on subsampling of single-subject permutations. Prevalence inference tests
497
the significance of above-chance accuracy in the majority of subjects given
498
the permutation distribution at an alpha level of 0.05. Permutation tests are
499
preferred over traditional tests against theoretical chance level, given that
500
the small amount of trials (typical for neuroimaging studies) will lead to

larger cross-validation errors (Varoquaux [2017]). Therefore, we computed
502
null-distributions on randomly re-labeled data for the GNB classification
503
task. For the binary classification task we randomly selected half of the
504
items per category (either attachment type of part of speech) and switched
505
their labels in order to maintain an equal amount of items per class. For
506
analyses conducted on the source-reconstructed data we used one fixed set
507
of permutations of the observations for each searchlight to preserve spatial
508
correlations.The procedure of generating a permutation and subsequent clas-
509
sification/prediction using permuted labels/semantic vectors was repeated
510
100 times per subject.
511
To evaluate statistical significance of the correlation values resulting from
512
the RSA analysis, we used nonparametric permutation tests against a base-

accuracy across subjects on this post-test did not differ between conditions

(verb and role condition both 81% correct) and subjects interpreted the sen-

were labeled according to subject-specific post-tests (see red and blue graphs

respectively in Figure 8).
542
3.2.2. 2-way classification Noun vs Verb
543
The 2-way classification on whether the currently seen stimulus was a
544
verb or a noun based on sensor-level MEG data reached a maximal average
545
accuracy (across subjects) of 67% at 160 ms after word onset and was sig-
546
nificantly more accurate as compared to the word position classifier (p=0,
547
cluster-corrected permutation tests) up until 460 ms after word onset (see
548
Figure 9). Note that classification accuracy is already significantly above
549
chance before the onset of the noun/verb. This is due to the fact that nouns
550
were always preceded by a determiner and verbs by a noun, effectively turn-
551
ing the baseline period into a determiner vs. noun classification sample. PCA
552
transformation of the data led to higher classification accuracy as compared
553
to training on the raw features. Additional feature selection based on class
554
means did not lead to further increases in accuracy (see Figure 10). Train-
555
ing the classifier on moving windows of length 100 ms not only was more
556
efficient in terms of computation time but also lead to higher classification
557
accuracies as compared to training the classifier per time point (see Figure

559
accuracies as compared to averaging over time points before training.
560
Besides Naive Bayes, we also tested different classification algorithms,
561
i.e. support vector machines and logistic regression. None of these resulted
562
in higher classification accuracies for the classification of nouns vs verbs (see
563
Figure 12) as compared to Naive Bayes. Logistic regression performed better
564
than Naive Bayes for the classification of determiner vs noun.
565
Given that nouns and verbs have some systematic orthographical dif-
566
ferences in German, we wanted to know whether classification success was
567
mostly driven by low-level visual cortex. To investigate this, we source-
568
reconstructed the MEG data and trained several classifiers on different re-
569
gionsacrossthecortex(searchlightapproach). Whileclassificationaccuracies
570
were overall lower than those observed based on the sensor-level data, they
571
were highest in occipital areas (see Figure 13). However, classification was
572
also significantly above chance in more anterior cortical areas. With increas-
573
ing time since word onset, classification accuracy increased as well in more
574
anterior, bilateral occipito-temporal areas (see Figure 13 middle panel for
575
Brodmann area 37). Between 340 ms and 540 ms, higher level areas like
576
left inferior central and inferior frontal areas contain information about the
577
noun-verb distinction (see Figure 13 lower panel for Brodmann area 43).

trained on either the original features (red), on a dimensionality reduced sensor
space after selecting only the first 60 components using principal component anal-
ysis (PCA, blue) or on a reduced feature space using PCA as well as further only
selecting the 150 sensor x timepoints with the largest difference in class means
(green). A baseline performance estimate was generated by repeatedly classifying
data after permuting labels (grey). While feature space reduction through PCA
improved classification accuracy, feature selection based on class means did not
yield further improvements.

better classification performance. Further, for a window width of 100ms averag-

ceding noun or verb would be reactivated in the presence of either a noun-
584
or verb-attachment respectively. We first investigated whether there was a
585
reactivation of morphosyntactic information (part of speech) by generalising
586
the 2-way classification trained on brain data measured during reading of
587
noun and verbs preceding the prepositional phrase to the period following
588
the final word of the sentence. Even though the final word was always a noun
589
we hypothesised that only verb-attached prepositional phrases would in ad-
590
dition lead to verb-like activity patterns following the final word. However,
591
contrary to our hypothesis the classifier trained on nouns and verbs in the
592
context did not accurately classify the post-sentence period of verb-attached
593
prepositional phrases as more verb-like (see Figure 14).
594
3.2.4. RSA
595
For our stimuli, the interpretation of a prepositional phrase attachment
596
was purely driven by semantic content. Therefore, we might also expect
597
any reactivation to occur in the form of semantic information. We therefore
598
testedwhetheratthetimeofdisambiguation,anyofthesemanticinformation
599
of preceding context would be reactivated. Specifically, we expected the
600
semantics of the verb to be more strongly activated at the end of a verb-
601
attached prepositional phrase and the semantics of the noun to be more
602
strongly activated at the end of a noun-attached prepositional phrase.
603
Our RSA revealed significant correlations between a model of the trial-
604
by-trial similarity derived from word embeddings and the pairwise similarity
605
derived from neural data evoked by the corresponding words (see Figure 15).
606
Activity patterns that correlated with semantic similarity first emerged in a
607
window from 380 ms to 480 ms in superior parietal cortex. Between 440 and

Figure 14: Generalised classification accuracy for part-of-speech.
We trained a classifier to distinguish between nouns and verbs based on the neu-
ral data evoked by reading one or the other. While training this classifier on a
moving time window starting at onset of the noun/verb, we then tested whether
the learned weights would generalise to data recorded while reading the end of
the corresponding sentence. To illustrate this on a specific stimulus example, on a
sentence like 7 “The insect frightens the child with the poisonous sting”, we would
train the classifier on distinguishing activity evoked by “frightens” from activity
evoked by “child” but we would test the classifier on activity evoked by “sting”.
Given that this sentence contains a verb-attached preposition, the correct label for
the classifier to identify would be “verb”, regardless of the final word always be-
ing a noun. Color codes for classification accuracy at any given training-by-testing

4. Discussion
618
In this study we applied MVPA to probe the neural signal for hierarchical
619
structure building during online reading of structurally ambiguous sentences.
620
Subjects read sentences containing verb-attached and noun-attached prepo-
621
sitional phrases ambiguous with respect to their attachment. We successfully
622
applied a Naive Bayes classifier to classify part-of-speech information of the
623
current stimulus from the multidimensional evoked neural activity. We also
624
successfully extracted neural patterns encoding semantic information of con-
625
tent words as subjects were reading them, through modelling the pairwise
626
semantic similarity structure of all word pairs (RSA) with corpus-extracted
627
word-embeddings. However, none of these measures revealed encoding of
628
different underlying hierarchical phrase structure for verb- vs noun-attached
629
sentences at the end of the sentence, when attachment information was dis-
630
ambiguated through combined semantic information. That is, we did not
631
find traces of stronger reactivation of either verb or noun in verb- or noun-
632
attached sentences respectively; not in terms of their part-of-speech identity
633
nor in terms of their semantic content. Nor were we able to directly train a
634
classifier to distinguish between verb- and noun-attached PPs across varying
635
lexical material. In the following, we will discus several potential explana-
636
tions for the absence of an effect.
637
4.1. Signal-to-noise ratio
638
Could it be that our analyses were simply not sensitive enough to reveal
639
effects of high-level processes such as phrase structure building? Previous
640
literature relying on MVPA to capture higher-level language processing does

not necessarily suggest high-level effects to be smaller as compared to more
642
perception related effects. For example, Tyler et al. used an RSA approach
643
to investigate the temporally unfolding syntactic computations during lis-
644
tening of temporarily ambiguous sentences (Tyler et al. [2013]). While their
645
more perceptual word identity model correlated robustly with neural activity
646
(rho > 0.015), when probing more abstract syntactic processing they found
647
both small and large effects. Specifically, their model quantifying verb sub-
648
categorization information was only marginally significant and correlations
649
were much weaker (rho ≈ 0.005) and only occurred on the word following
650
the verb (n+1). Their model distinguishing ambiguous from unambiguous
651
sentences, however, correlated even more strongly (rho > 0.020) with neu-
652
ral activity at late time points. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to
653
compare these effect sizes to our study. Our approach is novel in that we
654
tried to directly probe neural representations of hierarchical phrase structure
655
rather than its consequence on ongoing processing demands (e.g. memory
656
requirements Nelson et al. [2017] or processing effort due to ambiguity Tyler
657
et al. [2013]). Therefore, it is not immediately clear from those prior studies
658
whether an MVPA approach is powerful enough to reveal representations of
659
phrase structure directly.
660
Through additional analyses, targeting orthogonal syntactic information
661
such as part-of-speech we tried to somewhat assess the sensitivity of our ap-
662
proach. Our Naive Bayes classifier reached a maximum average accuracy of
663
67% when trained to distinguish nouns from verbs. Above chance level per-
664
formance was observed robustly across all subjects. Part-of-speech although
665

ture and hence our classifier captured information beyond perceptual signals.
667
It is important to note, that within our design, the part-of-speech contrast is
668
partly confounded by physical attributes of the stimulus. Specifically, nouns
669
and verbs differ in their form as well as their syntactic function (e.g. the
670
majority of verbs ended in the same inflexional syllable -t signalling third
671
person singular). We must assume that any decoding success is partly due
672
to stimulus form. Still, our observations that part-of-speech information can
673
bedecodedfromanteriorbrainregionsinadditiontooccipitalcortexsuggests
674
that information was not solely based on the wordform differences. Hence,
675
while the part-of-speech classifier provides some indication to the utility of
676
the data with respect to higher-level features, it does not necessarily ensure
677
the success of decoding more higher-level phenomena such as hierarchical
678
structure.
679
Furthermore, we also set out to find semantic and syntactic reactivation
680
of structurally relevant context as a direct consequence of phrase structure
681
building. Brain data and semantic models correlated with a maximum corre-
682
lation coefficient smaller than 0.01. This coefficient describes the correlation
683
with data evoked by stimuli on screen and correlations can be expected to
684
be substantially smaller when looking at the reactivation period. It is plau-
685
sible to assume that reactivated neural patterns are harder to detect, as they
686
are not directly evoked by a stimulus. In the present analyses, we focused
687
on the time window following the onset of the final word. Content of the
688
final word, however, was orthogonal to the supposedly reactivated informa-
689
tion. For example, the last word of the sentence was always a noun and
690
the same nouns (same semantic information) were presented in both verb-

and noun-attached version. Nonetheless, in half of the trials (namely the
692
verb-attached phrases), we would expect reactivation to reflect semantic and
693
syntactic information of the preceding verb. The question is, whether MVPA
694
is sensitive to internally generated, behaviourally relevant information, even
695
with interfering material driving the neural response. While decoding of se-
696
mantic category membership has been shown in the absence of a stimulus
697
on screen (Simanova et al. [2015]), this was only shown for single words. To
698
our knowledge there are no language studies explicitly probing reactivation
699
in sentence context through MVPA. Within vision research, however, it has
700
been shown that during a visual working memory tasks, information about
701
stimulus orientation could be decoded from EEG during the retention period
702
only through perturbation using an impulse stimulus (so called ‘ping’) but
703
would otherwise be undetected (Wolff et al. [2017]). The authors argue that
704
relevant information is not encoded explicitly in a persistent activity state
705
but through an item-specific neural response profile that needs to be probed
706
in order to affect ongoing neural activity. This might also explain why pre-
707
vious effects of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity were found not
708
directly following the disambiguating word but on subsequent words (Tara-
709
ban and McClelland [1988]; Boudewyn et al. [2014]). Since we did not have a
710
sentence continuation after the disambiguating noun, we may have been less
711
sensitive to alterations in response profile caused by attachment structure.
712
Finally, it is possible, that our sensitivity was reduced by temporal vari-
713
ability in processing of the ambiguous sentences. It can be observed in the
714
literature, that decoding accuracies are usually largest soon after stimulus
715
onset and then decrease with increasing time (Cichy et al. [2014]; van Es

et al. [2020]). We observe a similar pattern for our part-of-speech clas-
717
sification performance, which peaks very early after word onset (160 ms)
718
but then decreases sharply until 250 ms after onset and continues to de-
719
crease thereafter. Thus, most information seems to be already encoded in
720
the onset-potential or at least the neural signal might become more salient
721
due to onset-related synchronisation of postsynaptic potentials. Effects of hi-
722
erarchical structure building however may be less strictly time-locked events.
723
Specifically, the varying difficulty in resolving structural ambiguities in our
724
stimuli might have caused the signal to be jittered in time such that any re-
725
activation might be less consistently synchronised across trials and subjects.
726
Generally, each stimulus evokes a cascade of brain processes (both bottom-
727
up and top-down) which all can vary slightly in their duration depending on
728
context and individual and may therefore lead to more substantial variation
729
inlater, high-levelbrainprocessingascomparedtoinitialbottom-upprocess-
730
ing. Such temporal variability might have led to lower sensitivity for finding
731
our effect as well. Future analyses should take temporal variability explicitly
732
into account to not encounter the same issue. To achieve this, probabilis-
733
tic frameworks for data-driven estimation of brain states could be used to
734
align processing and overcome temporal variability. For example, Vidaurre
735
et al. have developed an analysis that not only defines multiple representa-
736
tional states that dynamically encode the stimulus but also specifies which
737
of these states is active when in time (Vidaurre et al. [2019]).

neural representations of hierarchical structure, we will now turn to some

any detailed syntactic processing and subjects may have been engaged in
745
“shallow” processing instead, similar to what has been reported before for
746
garden-path sentences under the term “good-enough processing” (Ferreira
747
and Patson [2007]; Ferreira and Lowder [2016]; Traxler [2014]). The idea of
748
good-enough processing is that readers often arrive at a semantic proposition
749
when interpreting a sentence without conducting a full syntactic (re)analysis.
750
The recently established link between shallow processing and information
751
structure (Ferreira and Lowder [2016]) further increases the plausibility of
752
prepositional phrases falling victim to this strategy as well. Specifically, Fer-
753
reira & Lowder suggest that processing effort is usually directed towards
754
parts of a sentence that constitute new rather than given information. The
755
motivation for such a strategy is twofold. Firstly, it would maximise the suc-
756
cess of integration of newly received information. And secondly, since given
757
information links to prior discourse it is also more likely to be redundant
758
and therefore more likely to survive “shallow” processing. It might not be
759
obvious why our experiment should be affected by such shallow processing,
760
given that we presented subjects with unrelated sentences without any larger
761
discourse context to drive information structure. PPs are, however, making
762
up the subordinate clause of the sentence, which is standardly viewed as
763
communicating previously known information (Hornby [1974]) rather than
764
new. Hence, it is possible that structurally inherent information structure in
765
sentences with PPs causes readers to allocate less processing resources onto

the structural disambiguation of the attachment. This would also be in line
767
with processing accounts where hierarchical operations are not assumed as
768
the default (Frank et al. [2012]). It is assumed that such processing strategies
769
can be overwritten by strong task demands. For example, previous research
770
has shown that syntactic task demands can reveal a P600 when there was
771
none evoked by a purely semantic task (Mongelli [2020]). Indeed, many pre-
772
vious studies probing syntactic processing make use of syntactic tasks such
773
as grammaticality judgments (Tyler et al. [2013]). In our study, however,
774
subjects had to respond in only 25% of the trials and even on those trials,
775
comprehension questions were not always probing knowledge about the PP
776
region. The absence of a task and the fact that thematic role assignment
777
could only be based on semantic cues in the first place may have discouraged
778
a deep analysis of phrase structure.
779
The good-enough processing hypothesis further implies that hierarchical
780
structure need not be computed at all in order to assign thematic roles. In-
781
stead, the semantic implications of the assigned thematic roles would be the
782
sole outcome of successful sentence processing. Semantics of thematic roles
783
are more complex and numerous than their possible corresponding phrase
784
structures. Through adopting a strictly binary distinction of verb- and noun
785
attachments we have intentionally ignored this semantic variation to target
786
only the structural differences. However, as mentioned before, phrase struc-
787
ture and thematic roles are somewhat related and hence can easily become
788
confounded. In fact, the relationship between thematic roles and syntactic
789
structure is somewhat asymmetric to begin with. While any given thematic

role is always bound to a certain syntactic structure2, this is not a bidirec-
791
tional relationship. For example an instrument role will always be expressed
792
in a verb-attached PP, but not every verb-attached phrase structure is nec-
793
essarily carrying information about instruments (see sentences 8 & 9 for
794
alternative role example).

797
Taraban et al. have shown that previously reported reading time effects
798
of PPs can be explained largely by expectations about thematic role. Specif-
799
ically, they showed that unexpected structural attachment (verb- or noun
800
attachment) do not delay reading times beyond the effect of thematic role
801
expectations (Taraban and McClelland [1988]). The P600 effects reported
802
by Boudewyn et al. could have also been driven by the semantics of the
803
associated thematic roles rather than structure per se. In their stimulus
804
set all verb-attached stimuli contained PPs expressing an instrument and all
805
noun-attachedPPsexpressedanattribute. Moreover, mostoftheirsentences
806
contained action verbs (which bias towards expectations for instrument roles
807
to begin with). Their P600 could therefore just as well be a marker for sur-
808
prisal due to the unexpected thematic role in noun-attached sentences. In
809
our study, we had more varying verb types (almost a third of all verbs were
810
perception verbs) and more varying thematic roles (see table 1). However,
811
the definition of thematic roles can be murky and the less common ones are

usually poorly defined. With the exception of agent and patient role, the
813
psychological reality of certain thematic roles (even as prominent as the in-
814
strument role) can be debated (Rissman and Majid [2019]). It is therefore
815
difficult to systematically manipulate this dimension. Nonetheless, through
816
using more varied thematic roles and verbs we have created a more natu-
817
ralistic stimulus set as compared to previous studies, potentially weakening
818
effects of thematic role expectations, that likely have been driving previous
819
findings of divergent neural activity between noun- and verb-attached PPs.

In conclusion, with this study we could not identify a neural represen-
821
tation of hierarchical structure using MVPA. We did show, however, that
822
our MVPA approach was in principle sensitive to both syntactic and seman-
823
tic information encoded in the neural signal. Further, we did not find any
824
differences between processing verb- or noun-attached prepositional phrases
825
unlike previous studies have suggested. We speculate that this was partly
826
due to our well controlled and semantically varied sentence material. In the
827
future, a more fine-grained characterisation of the semantic dimensions driv-
