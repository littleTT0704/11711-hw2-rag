guidelinesforthecareanduseoflaboratoryanimals.Asummary
of the cohorts and the conditions they represent are presented in
Table 1. Limb transplantations including skin, muscle, bone and
vessels, were performed as per a standardized technique between
eight- to ten-week-old male Brown-Norway (BN) and Lewis rats
(LEW) weighing 200–250 g with (group 3) or without (group 1)
immunosuppressionandcomparedwithuntreatedisografts(group
2)[8].Animalswereanesthetizedwithacombinationofxylazine
(Xylasol, 5 mg/kg) and ketamine (Ketavet, 100mg/kg), injected
intramuscularly.
Assessment of rejection
Animals were inspected daily for signs of rejection. Skin
rejection was classified per appearance: Grade 0 – no signs of
rejection;GradeI–erythemaofthetransplantedleg,GradeII–
erythema and edema, Grade III – epidermolysis of the
transplanted skin, Grade IV – mummification of the leg (limb
necrosis). In untreated animals (allografts, ATC), rejection occurs
after 3-4 days (Grade I rejection) and progresses to Grade IV
rejection between day 9 and 11. Samples from allograft skin and
musclewere collected atpostoperative days(POD) 3,5,7, 9and
11inallthreegroupsinastaggeredfashion.Tooutruleanimpact
ofthetraumaanthereadoutofsubsequenttissuesamples,biopsies
weretakenfromsitesdistanttoanotherondays3,5,7and11,or
days 5, 9 and 11 (see Table 2). Since all animals showed
mummification of the graft on POD 11 with super infection in
some,samplesfromthistimepointwereexcludedfromthestudy.
The size of each tissue biopsy per chosen time point was
approximately 25610mm.Thistissuesamplewasdividedinto3
identical parts for further analyses. One biopsy part (piece) was
fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed routinely for
hematoxilynandeosin(H&E)staining.Sectionswereevaluatedfor
lymphocytic infiltration, dermal/epidermal interphase reaction,
dermal-epidermal separation and necrosis by a pathologist in a
blinded fashion. The other biopsy parts were preserved in
RNALater forproteinanalysis andRNA isolation.
Protein isolation and protein expression analysis
Proteins from skin and muscle samples were isolated using a
disperser (T10, basic ULTRA-TURRAX, IKA, Germany) with
1 ml 1 x Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA) per
sampleonice.Proteinswerequantifiedafterhomogenizingusing
the BCA Protein Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Inflammatory mediator expression at the protein levels was
measured using the Luminex inflammatory mediator bead set
(RCYTO-80K-PMX-14-plex Milliplex Map Kit from Millipore,
Billerica,MA)thatincludedinterferon(IFN)-c,IL-1a,IL-1b,IL-2,
IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-18, monocyte chemotactic

Statistical and computational analysis
Analyses were performed with the statistical framework R
2.13.1usingpackagesincludingstats,nnet,multtest,MASS,beeswarm,
randomForest. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
compare mediator abundance among groups 1-3 (ATC, ISO,
TAC)atPOD3/POD5.TheWilcoxonrank-sumtestwasusedto
identify the tissue levels of those mediators whose levels varied
significantly between animals exhibiting rejection (ATC) and
animalstreatedwithtacrolimustopreventrejection(TAC)inthe
early postoperative phase (POD 3/POD 5), as well for selected
inflammatorymediatorsatPOD3.Allp-valueswereadjustedfor
multiplehypothesistestingbasedonthefalsediscoveryrate(FDR)
[9].
The multivariate extension of the one-way analysis of variance
(MANOVA) or the discriminant function analysis (based on the
same formulation as MANOVA with inflammatory mediators as
independent variables and the rejection group as dependent
variableinthelattercase)areusedtodeterminethecoefficientsof
the two orthogonal discriminant vectors (DV), which enable
maximalseparationofthegroups.Asameasureofcontributionto
thesevectorsforeachmediator,thesumoftheabsolutevaluesof
the respective coefficients (loadings) were used and related to the
overall sum. Pillai’s trace statistic was used to test for the
differences in the vectors of means. The mediators showing
significant differences among the 3 groups and with .2.5%
contributiontotheDVsinbothskinandmuscleweresubjectedto
multinomial(logistic)regressionanalyses.Amodelforskinandone
model for muscle were selected based on minimal Akaike
information criterion [AIC]. Classifier performance was assessed
using a 8-fold cross validation procedure and visualized using
confusiontables.Accuracywasdefinedas1-misclassificationrate
andWelch’stestwasusedtotestthedifferencesbetweenthemean
of the number of true predicted and the mean of the sum of the
respective number offalse predicted.
To assess similarity of inflammatory mediator levels among
different time pointsand tissue types, complete-linkage hierarchi-
cal clustering was performed and visualized as heat map using
Genesis [10] based on mean-centered log2-transformed profiles.
Forthisanalysis,themeanvalueforeachgroupandmediatorwas
used.
ARandomForest(RF)[11]approachwasusedforclassification
oftherejectiongroup(ATC,ISO,TAC)includingalltimepoints.
This method was also used to identify those mediators most
important for classification or diagnosis. Classifier performances
wereassessedbyconfusiontablesandtheout-of-bag(OOB)error
rate.PrincipalComponentAnalysis(PCA)wasusedtorankmost
variable (important) mediators and potential therapeutic target
candidates[12].PCAreducesamultidimensionaldatasettoafew
principal components, which account for the most variability in
the dataset. The underlying hypothesis is that a mediator which
changes during a process is important to that process [12,13]. In
thisanalysis,thedatawerecombinedfromskinandmuscle,mean
centered,andvariancescaled.Componentssufficienttocaptureat

Inflammatory mediators at early time points discern the
procedure to which animals were subjected
A major goal of this study was to determine markers for early
and accurate diagnosis of skin rejection in advance of major
histological alterations. We applied several multivariate multino-

inflammatory mediators (GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-12p70, IL-5, and

Based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which is a
measureofthetrade-offbetweenthecomplexityofthemodel,i.e.
number of variables, and the goodness of fit, optimal models for
differentiationofthestudygroupscouldbefoundinskinrejection
(based on IL-4, IL-12p70, and TNF-a: AIC=16.0; residual
deviance=1.761024) and in muscle (based on IL-12p70 and
TNF-a: AIC=12.0; residual variance=1.661024). The coeffi-
cients of the inflammatory mediators in the logistic regression
models and classifier performance as assessed by 8-fold cross

thestudygroups(ATCvs.TAC,TACvs.ISO,ISOvs.ATC)and
applying a leave-one-out cross validation strategy resulted in an

(ROC) for skin of 0.5, 0.69, and 0.86 and for muscle of 1.0, 1.0,
and 1.0, indicating a substantially better discrimination than by
chance(AUC=0.5)(Table 6).

in the color bar (Figure 3). The dendrogram on the x-axis shows
the similarities among the samples. As expected, the rejection
group (ATC skin and muscle samples), especially samples from
later time points with pronounced histological changes, exhibit a
completely different mediator clustering pattern vs. the control
