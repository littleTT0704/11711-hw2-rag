Wiki-Pi:AWeb-ResourceofHumanPPIs
Individualized Page for Each PPI
A webpage of a PPI consists of two sections: an automatically
generated annotation section with detailed annotations describing the
interaction and its participant proteins, and a wiki section where
users can discuss the interaction. The details of the annotation
section fromtoptobottom areas follows(see Figure1).
