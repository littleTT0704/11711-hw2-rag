Erratum
In Section 5 of the article “Dependency Parsing of Turkish” by Gu¨ls¸en Eryig˘it, Joakim
Nivre,andKemalOflazer(September2008,Vol.34,No.3:357–389),someabbreviations
weremisinterpretedduringthecopyeditingprocess.
The third sentence of Section 5.2 should be as follows: “We use an unlexicalized
feature model where the parser uses only the minor part-of-speech category (as POS)
anddependencytypeoftokens(asDEP)andcomparetheresultswiththeprobabilistic
parser.”
ThefirstsentenceofthesecondparagraphofSection5.2.1shouldstartasfollows:
“Wetaketheminorpart-of-speechcategory....”
The “POS” abbreviation used on page 20 should be read as “minor part-of-
speech,” and the “POS” abbreviations on pages 21, 26, 27, and 28 should be read as
“part-of-speech.”
