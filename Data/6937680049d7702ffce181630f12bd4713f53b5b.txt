Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent birth defect, affecting nearly 1% of live
births1, but the incidence of CHD is up to ten fold higher in human fetuses2,3. A genetic
contribution is strongly suggested by the association of CHD with chromosome abnormalities and
high recurrence risk4. Here we report findings from a recessive forward genetic screen in fetal
mice, showing the cilium and cilia transduced cell signaling play important roles in the
pathogenesis of CHD. The cilium is an evolutionarily conserved organelle projecting from the cell
surface with essential roles in diverse cellular processes. Using echocardiography, we ultrasound
scanned 87,355 chemically mutagenized C57BL/6J fetal mice and recovered 218 CHD mouse
models. Whole exome sequencing identified 91 recessive CHD mutations in 61 genes. This
included 34 cilia-related genes, 16 genes involved in cilia transduced cell signaling, and 10 genes
regulating vesicular trafficking, a pathway important for ciliogenesis and cell signaling.
Surprisingly, many CHD genes encoded interacting proteins, suggesting an interactome protein
network may provide a larger genomic context for CHD pathogenesis. These findings provide
novel insights into the potential Mendelian genetic contribution to CHD in the fetal population, a
segment of the human population not well studied. We note pathways identified show overlap
with CHD candidate genes recovered in CHD patients5, suggesting they may have relevance to the
more complex genetics of CHD overall. These CHD mouse models and >8,000 incidental
mutations are sperm archived, creating a rich public resource for human disease modeling.
Inbred C57BL/6J mice mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea (ENU) were bred to recover
recessive coding mutations (Extended Data Fig. 1). Phenotyping was conducted using
noninvasive fetal echocardiography, an ultrasound imaging modality also employed
clinically for CHD diagnosis. This unbiased study design allows detection of even those
CHD mutants inviable to term6, a segment of CHD cases that would be largely clinically
inaccessible for genetic analysis. Using combination of color flow, 2D, spectral Doppler and
M-mode imaging, a wide spectrum of CHD phenotypes were recovered, including cardiac
looping defects, OFT malalignment/septation defects, ventricular/atrioventricular septal
defects, and various right/left heart obstructive lesions6 (Figure 1; Supplemental Movies S1-
S3). The CHD diagnoses were confirmed with microCT/microMRI, necropsy, and
histopathology (Extended Data Fig. 1). Heritability was ascertained with recovery of two or
more G3 fetuses with the same CHD phenotype (n=4.6±2.6). Ultrasound scanning of 87,355
G3 fetuses from 2,651 mutant lines (defined by the G1 sire) recovered 218 CHD mutant
lines. These were curated in the Mouse Genome Informatics Database (http://
www.informatics.jax.org/searchtool/Search.do?query=b2b&submit=Quick%0D
%0ASearch), with G1 sperm cryopreserved in the Jackson Laboratory (JAX®Mice).
Many mutant lines (30%) exhibited complex CHD associated with heterotaxy, the
randomization of left-right patterning. These heterotaxy mutants often died prenatally. We
note clinical studies show 16% of human fetuses with complex CHD have heterotaxy7, and

these also exhibit high prenatal/intrauterine death (30-60%)8,9. Also commonly observed in
mutant lines with or without laterality defects are double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and
atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), phenotypes that usually resulted in prenatal lethality.
We note DORV and AVSD are also observed with high prevalence in aborted/stillborn
human fetuses3. Most heterotaxy mutant lines exhibited three distinct visceral organ situs
phenotypes: normal situs solitus, mirror symmetric situs inversus, or randomization with
heterotaxy, with complex CHD observed only with heterotaxy (Extended Data Fig. 2).
These three phenotypes are found in patients and mice with mutations causing primary
ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)10,11, a sinopulmonary disease arising from immotile/dyskinetic
respiratory cilia. This reflects the common requirement for motile cilia in airway clearance
and left-right patterning11,12. Hence, we conducted videomicroscopy of the tracheal
epithelia to assess cilia motility as a proxy for the node.
Mutation recovery was conducted with whole exome sequencing analysis of a single mutant
from each of 113 mutant lines. Cumulatively this yielded 7,996 coding mutations in 4,809
genes (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Genotyping analysis identified the pathogenic mutation as
one consistently homozygous across all G3 mutants bearing the same phenotype. In mutant
lines with multiple homozygous mutations on the same chromosome linked to the CHD
phenotype, the pathogenic mutation was identified with segregation analysis of additional
mutants, and/or based on phenotype comparison to existing knockout/mutant alleles. For
five lines (b2b002/b2b012/b2b284/b2b1519/b2b1146), the mutation was confirmed with
mapping analyses13.
In this manner, 91 pathogenic mutations were recovered in 61 genes (Supplemental
Spreadsheet 1). The distribution of missense/splicing/nonsense mutations were similar to
other ENU mutagenesis studies14 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). All mutations except one were in
highly conserved amino acids (Supplemental Spreadsheet 2). Five of the 19 splicing
mutations are >2-bases from the canonical splice donor-acceptor sites, the farthest being 10
bases apart (Dnah5c.13329-10T>A;b2b1537; validated by cDNA sequencing, Extended Data
Fig. 4). Multiple alleles were recovered in 15 genes (Extended Data Table 1). Of 61 CHD
genes recovered, 27 were not previously annotated to cause CHD (Extended Data Fig. 3b),
either because no mutant/knockout mice were available, or the CHD phenotype was not
investigated (Supplemental Spreadsheet 1). In some instances, the existing mutants died
early, precluding CHD analysis, such as the Smarca4 knockout mouse with peri-
implantation lethality15. A Hectd1 mutant was previously described only with neural tube
defects16 versus our Hectd1b2b327 mutant shown to have aortic atresia (Figure 1c,d). The
identical Adamts6 mutation was found in 3 lines, shown to be a spontaneous mutation in the
C57BL6/J support colony (Supplemental Spreadsheet 1).
Thirty-four of the 61 CHD genes are cilia-related (Figure 2), 23 in laterality mutant lines
(Extended Data Table 2, Fig.3a,5). Twelve are required for motile cilia function, with 8
clinically known to cause PCD and 3 likely novel PCD genes (Ccdc151,Daw,Pkd1l1)
(Extended Data Tables 2,3; Supplemental Spread Sheet 1). A mutation was recovered in
Foxj1, a transcription factor known to regulate ciliogenesis. While Foxj1 knockout mice
have no cilia in the airway17, our Foxj1b2b774 mutant harboring a missense mutation in the

DNA binding domain has ciliated trachea with robust ciliary motion (Supplemental Movie
S4), but with no nodal flow (Supplemental Movie S5).
Mutations in 22 ciliome genes affect primary cilia - 11 in laterality and 11 in nonlaterality
mutant lines (Extended Data Table 2, Fig. 3a,5). Among nonlaterality mutants are Cep110 -
centrosome component, Jbts17 - cilia transition zone protein, and four other genes
(Fuz,Myh10,Dctn5,Lrp2) that also play important roles in vesicular/endocytic trafficking, a
biological process essential for ciliogenesis18,19 (Figure 2). Many genes affecting laterality
are associated with non-PCD ciliopathies (Anks6,Bicc1,Tbc1d32,
Cep290,Dync2h1,Ift74,Ift140,Nek8,Pcsk5,Pskh1,Cc2d2a,Tmem67; Extended Data Table
3)20,21. Analysis of Cc2d2a mutant embryo by confocal imaging showed shorter and fewer
cilia throughout the embryo (Figure 1s-x). In Cc2d2a mutant embryo, while cilia were
abundant in outflow cushions, they were absent in AV cushions (Figure 1p,r). Consistent
with this, Cc2d2a mutant embryos die prenatally with AVSD (Figure 1l,n), but with normal
semilunar valves (Figure 1m,n).
Of the 26 non-ciliome CHD genes, 15 are known to mediate cell signaling, including SHH
(Fuz,Kif7,Lrp2,Sufu,Tbc1d32), WNT/planar cell polarity (Ptk7,Prickle 1,Fuz), TGF-p/BMP
(Cfc1,Ltbp1,Megf8, Pcsk5,Smad6,Tab1), and calcium signaling (Pkd1l1,Pkd1) (Figure 2).
Five of these were recovered in the laterality mutant lines
(Tbc1d32,Cfc1,Megf8,Pcsk5,Pkd1l1). These pathways are all transduced or modulated by
the cilium, and play significant roles in cardiovascular development and/or left-right
patterning.
We also recovered 10 CHD genes mediating vesicular/endocytic trafficking, including four
(Lrp2,Myh10,Dctn5mFuz) that are ciliome related (Figure 2). The enrichment for endocytic
genes may be mechanistically linked to cilia, as vesicular trafficking at the cilia base has
important roles in both ciliogenesis and cilia transduced cell signaling18,19,22. These
endocytic genes caused a similar spectrum of OF malalignment and septation defects
(Extended Data Fig. 6). Only Ap1b1, an adaptin subunit mediating endocytic protein sorting
in the Golgi was observed to cause laterality defects (b2b1660; Extended Data Fig. 2).
While Ap1b1 mutants showed normal airway and embryonic node cilia motility
(Supplemental Movie S6,S7), Ap1b1 mutant embryonic fibroblasts exhibited ciliogenesis
defect (65% vs. 85% ciliation in Ap1b1 mutant versus wildtype fibroblasts;p=5.90×10-6).
Ap2b1, an adaptin protein complex 2 subunit homologous to Ap1b1, functions in clathrin
mediated endocytosis. Snx17, known to regulate endocytic receptor recycling, has a
mutation in the cargo binding FERM domain, region known to interact with the NPXY
motif of endocytic protein LRP1, which was also recovered in our screen (Extended Data
Fig.3b).
Other CHD genes recovered included a novel zinc finger protein Zbtb14, and two genes
modulating chromatin, Smarca4 and Prdm1. Also recovered were six extracellular matrix
related genes (Acan,Adamts6, Frem2,Lox,Mmp21,Ndst1), one (Lox) identified as cilia-
related, three novel genes (Cml5,Gm572,Mmp21) causing CHD with laterality defects, and
two genes (Acan, Pkd1) causing biventricular hypertrophy without other structural heart
defects.

Many of the CHD genes encode proteins known to physically interact or are in the same
multiprotein complexes. For example, ANKS6 can bind BICC1 and also NEK8, with NEK8/
ANKS6 colocalizing in the cilia inversin compartment24,25. TMEM67, CEP290, JBTS17,
and CC2D2A are colocalized in the NPHP1-4-8 multiprotein complex in the cilia transition
zone23. DNAH5, DNAH11, DNAI1 and DAW1 are associated with the outer dynein arm
complex of motile cilia, while IFT140 and IFT74 are intraflagellar transport protein
components that together with DYNC2H1 mediate protein transport in the cilium (Figure
2)18,20. SNX17 can directly bind LRP1 to promote LRP1 cell surface recycling26. These
findings prompted an examination of the 113 exomes for the prevalence of additional
mutations in the 61 CHD genes. This showed 58 additional incidental mutations in 32 of the
CHD genes, a significant enrichment compared to random simulations (P=0.00114;Online
Methods), suggesting possible modifier effects.
To further assess for potential protein-protein interactions (PPI), we constructed an
interactome of CHD genes using known PPIs in the public databases and our own
computationally predicted PPIs (Online Methods). This yielded an interactome of 778 genes,
292 are predicted PPIs (Supplemental Spreadsheet 3;Figure 3a). The average shortest
distance between CHD genes is 4.3±2.5 edges, whereas random genes of matched degree
distribution had a larger distance of 5.7±4.4 edges (P=0.01). Statistical analysis of the
interactome revealed significant Go Ontology term enrichment related to development,
including heart development terms (Supplemental Spreadsheet 3;Figure 3b). Pathways
identified included “clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling”, “TGFβ signaling”, “BMP
signaling” and “axon pathfinding” (Supplemental Spreadsheet 3). Several CHD genes
recovered are known to regulate axon guidance and neurogenesis, including Plxnd1, Robo1,
and Cxcr4, while Pde2a regulates synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation, and Myh10
is required for synaptic membrane recycling (Extended Data Fig.7).
Overall, our study provides compelling evidence that the cilium plays a critical role in CHD
pathogenesis. The observed enrichment for cilia and cilia-related genes emerged from a
phenotype driven forward genetic screen agnostic to the specific genes that may be
recovered. The finding of ciliome mutations in CHD mutant lines with and without laterality
defects would suggest a broad role for cilia in CHD pathogenesis. While our study is
focused on monogenic recessive coding mutations, we noted striking overlap of genes
recovered in the mouse screen versus heterozygous de novo coding mutations in CHD
candidate genes identified in CHD patients5. Of 28 CHD genes identified in the human
study - 11 are cilia-related, 7 are in TGFb/SHH/WNT signaling, and 2 in vesicular/endocytic
trafficking (Supplemental Spread Sheet 4). Heterozygous mutation in PITX2, a gene
essential for left/right patterning12, was recovered in a non-heterotaxy CHD patient,
suggesting a broader role for left-right patterning in CHD pathogenesis. The human study
identified an important role for genes regulating chromatin. Consistent with this, our screen
recovered two mouse CHD genes modulating chromatin, Smarca4 and Prdm15. Hence,
findings from our fetal mouse screen may provide insights not only on Mendelian recessive
genetic contribution to CHD in the unborn, a segment of the CHD population not well
studied, but these findings also may have relevance to the complex genetics of CHD overall.
The CHD mouse models generated in this study are invaluable resources for interrogating

Online Methods
Congenital Heart Defect Phenotyping
C57BL/6J mice were chemically mutagenized using ethylnitrosourea and subject to a two
generation backcross breeding scheme27. To identify CHD mutants, G3 fetuses were
ultrasound scanned with a two-tier ultrasound phenotyping strategy using the Acuson
Sequoia and Vevo2100 ultrasound systems as previously described6. The fetal ultrasound
imaging was conducted at E13.5-15.5, after completion of major cardiovascular
developmental processes, including outflow tract septation and ventricular chamber
septation. All of the CHD diagnoses were confirmed or refined by additional analysis using
micro-CT/micro-MRI analyses and 3D histopathology using episcopic confocal
microscopy6,28 (Extended Data Figure 1). The summative CHD diagnosis and phenotype
description are curated in the public Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database
(www.informatix.jax.org; enter search box “b2b” will pull up all the lines or type in specific
line ID or MGI ID to go directly to a specific mutant line). Included in each mutant line
MGI record are sample images and videos collected from various different imaging
modalities, including ultrasound images and videos, necropsy images, microCT/microMRI
scans, episcopic confocal microscopy image stacks and 3D reconstructions, histology, and
high speed videos for analysis of tracheal airway cilia motility.
Cilia Videomicroscopy
Trachea of newborn mice were harvested and mounted as previously described. For nodal
cilia imaging, the node-containing region of E7.5-E7.75 embryos (3-6 somite stages) was
dissected and mounted on a glass coverslip10. Videomicroscopy was carried out using a
Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope at 37°C with a 100× oil objective, and DIC optics. To
examine flow, 0.35 μm microspheres were added to the medium bathing the ciliated tissue
samples (∼1 × 1011 particles/ml, Polysciences, Inc.). High-speed videos (200 fps) were
collected using a Phantom v4.2 camera (Vision Research, NJ).
Mutation Recovery with Whole Exome Sequencing Analysis
Genomic DNA from CHD mutant mice were sequence captured using Agilent SureSelect
Mouse All Exon kit V1, and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 with minimum average
50× target sequence coverage (BGI Americas). Sequence reads were aligned to C57BL/6J
mouse reference genome (mm9) and analyzed using CLCBio Genomic Workbench and
GATK software. To minimize false-negatives, variant calls were set at 5× minimum
coverage and >20% alternate reads. Sequence variants were annotated with annovar (http://
www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/) and filtered against dbSNP128 and our in-house
mouse exome databases with custom scripts. Intronic variants within 10bp from the splice
junction were annotated as potential splicing mutation. All of the mutations recovered are
searchable together with phenotype information via the public Bench to Bassinet Congenital
Heart Disease Mouse Mutation Database (http://benchtobassinet.com/ForResearchers/

datasets are available from the GNomEx CvDC Datahub (https://b2b.hci.utah.edu/gnomex/
gnomexGuestFlex.jsp?topicNumber=67).
Ciliome Gene Annotation
Ciliome genes were derived from a compilation of multiple bioinformatics, genomic and
proteomic studies in different species29. This included a bioinformatics study of X-box
containing genes in C. elegans and several proteomic and comparative genomic studies
comprising ciliated organisms in several species (C. elegans, Drosophila, Human,
Chlamydomonas, Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma). In addition, we also included
genes recently identified in the cilia transition zone complex23 and genes identified to cause
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-ciliary-dyskinesia/
show/Related+Gene(s)).
Analysis of Splicing Defect Mutations
For analysis of splicing defect mutations, RNA was isolated from skin, trachea, or heart
tissue and reverse transcribed to generate cDNA using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit
(Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification of the cDNA was carried out with primers
spanning the affected splice junction using AmpliTaq Gold™ DNA polymerase system
(Life Technologies) (95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s at 72°C for 1
min, 72°C for 5 min). The amplified products were separated on a 3% agarose gel and the
bands were excised using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by Sanger
capillary sequencing.
Simulation-based Mutation Enrichment Analysis
A simulation approach was used to test whether mutations in the 61 CHD genes are enriched
in the mouse exome datasets generated from the 113 CHD mutant mouse lines. From the
113 exomes, we recovered 149 mutations in the 61 CHD genes, 91 of which were identified
as pathogenic, yielding an excess of 58 incidental mutations. For this simulation, all the
genes from the mouse genome were grouped in bins of 500 genes based on coding DNA
sequence (CDS) length. Then 61 genes with the same size distribution as the observed 61
CHD genes were randomly sampled. For each bin that contained k of our 61 CHD genes, we
randomly sampled k genes, and counted the number of mutations in these genes in the 113
mouse exomes. Based on 50,000 sets of 61 randomly sampled genes, we calculated a p-
value based on the count of random gene sets that harbored 149 or more mutations. To take
potential gene coverage bias into account, we limited our random gene selection to genes
with at least one coding mutation in our CHD exomes, which yielded p-value of 0.00114.
When we choose random genes from all genes, including genes not found in our exome
dataset, p-value is <0.00002.
Interactome Analysis
To construct the interactome, each of the mouse CHD genes was mapped to its human
ortholog, and PPIs of these genes were extracted from HPRD (www.hprd.org) and BioGRID
(thebiogrid.org). The interactome is augmented with PPIs discovered computationally using
the recently developed HiPPIP model (unpublished results). Pathway and Gene Ontology

term enrichment analysis of the interactome were carried out using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis suite and BiNGO30 plugin of Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/). P-value for
each pathway and GO term was calculated using Fisher's exact test with Benjamini-
Hochberg correction (Supplementary Spread Sheet 3). Shortest paths were computed using
Dijkstra's algorithm implemented in the networkx package of python. Average length of the
shortest paths between pairs of CHD genes was compared to that of 61 random genes, where
random genes were sampled to have similar degree distribution as the 61 CHD genes. For
this, all human genes were categorized into 7 bins based on their degree in the interactome,
(0, 1-5, 6-25, 26-50, 51-75, 75-100, >100). As many random genes were selected from any
bin as the number of CHD genes in that bin. This process was repeated 1,500 times, and
average length of the shortest paths is computed each time. P-value is computed empirically
to determine statistical significance.

Figure 1. Ultrasound diagnoses of CHD and cilia defects in CHD mutants
Vevo 2100 color flow imaging showed criss-crossing of blood flow indicating normal aorta
(Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA) alignment (a, Supplemental Movie S1), confirmed by
histopathology (b). E16.5 mutant (line b2b327) exhibited blood flow pattern indicating
single great artery (PA) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (c, Supplemental Movie S2),
suggesting aortic atresia with VSD, confirmed by histopathology (d). Color flow imaging of
E15.5 mutant (line b2b2025) with heterotaxy (stomach on right; Supplemental Movie S3c)
had side-by-side Ao/PA with Ao emerging from right ventricle (RV), indicating
DORV/VSD (e,f,Supplemental Movie S3a), and presence of AVSD (g,h,Supplemental
Movie S3b,S3c). Histopathology also showed bicuspid aortic valve (BAV,i), interrupted
aortic arch (IAA,j), and common AV valve (k). (l-n). Cc2d2a mutant exhibits dextrocardia
with ventricular inversion (dextroversion) (m), and AVSD (l) with malformed AV cushions
(n), but normal outflow cushions. (o-x). Confocal imaging of E12.5 Cc2d2a mutant (m/m)
vs. wildtype (+/+) embryo sections showed no cilia in AV cushion (o,p), but normal ciliation
in outflow cushion (q,r). Fewer and shorter cilia were observed in other mutant embryo
tissues (s-x). Red:acetylated tubulin;green:IFT88.

Figure 3. Interactome network of CHD genes with known and predicted interactors
An interactome network was constructed (a) comprising the 61 CHD genes (magenta
squares) and their known (blue edges) and predicted (red edges) interactions. The CHD
interactome yielded significant enrichment of GO terms related to developmental processes.
Circle size proportional to number of genes associated with GO terms.
