The emerging field of vascular composite allotransplantation (VCA) has become a clinical reality. Building upon cutting edge
understandings of transplant surgery and immunology, complex grafts such as hands and faces can now be transplanted with
success.Manyofthechallengesthathavehistoricallybeenlimitingfactorsintransplantation,suchasrejectionandthemorbidity
ofimmunosuppression,remainchallengesinVCA.BecauseoftheaccessibilityofmostVCAgrafts,andthehighlyimmunogenic
