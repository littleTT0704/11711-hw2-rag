Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen representing a global health concern. It has
been linked to fetal microcephaly and other birth defects and neurological disorders in adults. Sanofi
Pasteur has engaged in the development of an inactivated ZIKV vaccine, as well as a live chimeric
vaccine candidate ChimeriVax-Zika (CYZ) that could become a preferred vaccine depending on future
ZIKV epidemiology. This report focuses on the CYZ candidate that was constructed by replacing the
pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) genes in the genome of live attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine
virus (YF 17D) with those from ZIKV yielding a viable CYZ chimeric virus. The replication rate of CYZ
in the Vero cell substrate was increased by using a hybrid YF 17D-ZIKV signal sequence for the prM
protein. CYZ was highly attenuated both in mice and in human in vitro models (human neuroblastoma
and neuronal progenitor cells), without the need for additional attenuating modifications. It exhibited
significantly reduced viral loads in organs compared to a wild-type ZIKV and a complete lack of
neuroinvasion following inoculation of immunodeficient A129 mice. A single dose of CYZ elicited high
titers of ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies in both immunocompetent and A129 mice and protected
animals from ZIKV challenge. The data indicate that CYZ is a promising vaccine candidate against ZIKV.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes spp mosquitoes. Genetically it belongs to the
Spondweni group of flaviviruses which is distinct from the four main flavivirus serocomplexes: yellow fever,
Japanese encephalitis (JE), dengue, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)1. ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda in 1947
from a febrile Rhesus monkey, and before 2007 circulated only in Africa and Asia, with very few described cases
of mild, dengue-like disease in humans. Clinical manifestations included fever, malaise, headache, dizziness,
anorexia, retro-orbital pain, and maculopapular skin rash. However, recent spread of the virus to the Pacific and
the Americas has been accompanied by an unprecedented increase in transmission rates and has linked ZIKV
infection to microcephaly and other birth defects in infants of mothers infected during pregnancy as well as neu-
rological disorders in adults, mostly Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)2. In addition to transmission by mosquitoes
which accounted for the vast majority of infections, sexual transmission has been well documented3.
The first ZIKV outbreak outside of Africa and Asia occurred in 2007 on Yap Island, Micronesia with 919 cases
(affecting 18% of the island population) of mild disease. This was followed by an outbreak in French Polynesia in
2013–2014 with approximately 8,750 cases of symptomatic infection, including 42 cases of GBS accompanied by
encephalitis, meningitis, paraesthesia, facial paralysis and/or myelitis. Brazil reported its first Zika case in May
2015 and the outbreak peaked in early 2016 with an estimated 1.3 million cases of disease and approximately
3,500 suspected microcephaly cases including 46 deaths in 20 states4. ZIKV has subsequently spread to other
Latin American countries and to the southern continental U.S. Despite a recent decline in cases, ZIKV remains a
significant emerging pathogen5.

As with other flaviviruses, ZIKV is a small (50 nm in diameter), enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus6.
Flavivirus particles contain a nucleocapsid composed of viral RNA and capsid protein (C) surrounded by a lipid
envelope containing the envelope glycoprotein (E) and membrane protein (M). The genomic RNA (~11,000
nucleotides in length) encodes a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions
(UTRs). The ORF is translated into a polyprotein precursor encoding three structural proteins (C, prM precursor
for mature M, and E) and nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1–NS5 required for virus replication in the cytoplasm of
infected cells. The polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral (NS2B/NS3) proteases to yield individual proteins.
Progeny virions bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported to the cell surface
through the exocytosis pathway7. The E protein is the main immunogen eliciting neutralizing antibodies that
are considered to be the primary correlate of protective immunity against flavivirus infection. Virus-specific
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response is the other key attribute of immunity. Multiple CD8+ and CD4+ CTL
epitopes have been characterized in various flavivirus structural and non-structural proteins8. All documented
ZIKV strains represent a single serotype and thus a vaccine based on one strain should be effective against other
circulating strains.
Flavivirus vaccines which have been in use for decades are either live attenuated vaccines (LAV) obtained
by empirical attenuation (17D vaccine against YF and SA14-14-2 vaccine against JE) or inactivated virus vac-
cines (INV) available for JE and TBE9. INVs require several doses for priming, followed by periodic boosters
to maintain immunity, while the main advantage of LAVs is that they generally require very few doses to elicit
durable protective immunity without the need for adjuvant. For example, YF 17D is considered one of the strong-
est immunogens ever developed, providing protection after a single dose that is believed to be life-long. It has
demonstrated safety for children beginning at 9 months of age and for adults, with serious adverse events occur-
ring extremely infrequently. Based on theoretical concerns, YF 17D vaccination is not recommended during
pregnancy and breastfeeding, but according to the WHO it can be administered during YF epidemics associated
with high transmission risk. Large numbers of pregnant women have been vaccinated in the past without any
evidence of adverse effects for the fetus10.
Sanofi Pasteur has developed a novel chimeric LAV platform, ChimeriVax, targeting dengue, JE and West
Nile (WN) viruses. ChimeriVax-JE and -DEN vaccines are now licensed human vaccines (IMOJEV™ and
Dengvaxia®). ChimeriVax vaccines are constructed by replacing the prM-E envelope protein genes in the YF
17D genome with heterologous flavivirus prM-E genes, resulting in highly attenuated and immunogenic chimeric
viruses with altered antigenic specificity. A number of studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the
safety and immunogenicity of ChimeriVax-based vaccines. In addition, similar to YF17D virus which has lost
its ability to be transmitted by mosquitoes, ChimeriVax vaccines are not transmitted by mosquito vectors9,11,12.
Various strategies are being pursued to develop an effective vaccine against Zika, such as INVs, LAVs, virus
vectored, recombinant protein, and nucleic acid based candidates5,13–17. Because a Zika vaccine must be safe for
pregnant women and their fetus, currently the preferred approaches are those that do not rely on replicating virus.
Nevertheless, depending on LAV characteristics as well as future ZIKV epidemiology, a LAV could become pref-
erable, e.g., if a LAV is proven to be safe for pregnant women or for universal vaccination of children before they
are sexually active to elicit long-lasting immunity after a single dose, similar to the rubella live vaccine. Here we
constructed a ChimeriVax-Zika (CYZ) candidate that efficiently replicates in Vero cells (an established substrate
for LAV production), and evaluated its attenuation and tissue tropism compared to wild-type (wt) ZIKV, and its
immunogenicity and protective efficacy in both in vitro and murine models.
Results
Construction of ChimeriVax-Zika (CYZ) candidates. CYZ vaccine viruses were constructed using
the prM-E gene cassette of the French Polynesia-2013 ZIKV strain, which was selected based on phylogenetic
analysis demonstrating that this strain belongs to the Asian-American lineage of ZIKV18 and because its prM-E
amino acid sequence is identical to recent strains isolated in Brazil (2015), Haiti (2014), Martinique (2015) and
Puerto Rico (2015). A CYZ-yfs variant was generated which contains the ZIKV prM-E genes inserted into the
YF 17D backbone in the same fashion as in other previously constructed ChimeriVax vaccine viruses9, between
the C/prM and E/NS1 signalase cleavage sites. Thus, the signal sequence for prM protein in this virus is derived
from YF 17D. Similar to YF 17D virus, cleavage probability at the C/prM signalase site of CYZ-yfs is relatively
low as determined with the SignalP3.0 program19 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-3.0) (Fig. 1A). It has
been proposed that inefficient signalase cleavage at the C/prM site is a prerequisite of efficient replication of
flaviviruses based on studies using YF 17D and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses20–22. Interestingly, cleavage
probability at this site of wt ZIKV was found to be significantly higher than YF 17D (Fig. 1A). To evaluate how
increasing the predicted cleavage efficiency would affect replication of the chimera, a CYZ-hs variant was con-
structed containing a hybrid YF 17D/ZIKV prM signal which increased the cleavage probability to that of ZIKV
(Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, growth curve analysis showed that while both chimeras replicated efficiently in Vero
cells, the CYZ-hs variant generated several-fold higher peak titers [≥8 log plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml at
10
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and 0.001 PFU/cell] compared to CYZ-yfs (Fig. 1C). Both variants formed
clear plaques that were larger than plaques of YF 17D parent (Fig. 1B) and were shown to be genetically stable
by sequencing at P2 (research stocks) and P5 passages. Control chimeras designated YF/Senegal-1894 and YF/
Cambodia-2010 were also constructed with prM-E genes from African and Asian ZIKV strains, Senegal-1984
(DAKAR 41519) and Cambodia-2010 (FSS 13025), containing the YF 17D-specific prM signal sequence. These
strains are unrelated to the recent outbreaks in the Pacific and Americas. The resulting chimeras replicated as
efficiently as CYZ-yfs in Vero cells (data not shown).
Because the attenuation profiles of CYZ-yfs and CYZ-hs chimeric viruses were unknown, other CYZ variants
were also engineered in parallel with additional attenuating modifications including 3 amino acid changes in the
E protein corresponding to the 3 attenuating JE SA14-14-2 vaccine-specific changes that had been incorporated

in the ChimeriVax-WN02 vaccine (E-107 L to F, E-316 A to V and E-440 K to R23,24, an Asn to Gln mutation at
E-154 residue ablating the N-linked glycosylation motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr in the E protein (variant CYZ-dg; based
on CYZ-hs with hybrid prM signal), and small deletions in the YF 17D-specific C protein (variant CYZ-dC with
residues PSR deleted at amino acids 40–42 of the C protein; based on CYZ-hs) and 3′UTR (deletion CAGGT at
nts 256–260 of the 3′UTR). Other modifications in these genome elements have been evaluated for their ability to
increase attenuation of various flavivirus vaccine candidates16,25–29. Deglycosylation of the E protein in the context
of whole wt ZIKV was recently shown to confer some attenuation, which however was deemed insufficient for a
safe vaccine candidate30. The additionally constructed CYZ variants were examined for replication in Vero cells
(generally they grew to titers up to 10-fold lower compared to the parental CYZ chimeras) and some for attenua-
tion/immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo (e.g., see below, and data not shown).
CYZ attenuation (after IC inoculation) and immunogenicity in immunocompetent
mice. Attenuation of CYZ-yfs and CYZ-hs variants was compared to the YF 17D benchmark and
ChimeriVax-JE vaccine controls in a highly sensitive suckling mouse neurovirulence test that had been used
extensively in the evaluation of other ChimeriVax vaccines31. Five-day old ICR suckling mice were inoculated
with viruses by the intra-cerebral (IC) route and observed for signs of disease and mortality for 21 days. The CYZ
variants caused only a few sporadic deaths at some of the doses tested (the intended doses were from −1 to 4 log
10
PFU) which was similar to the highly attenuated ChimeriVax-JE control32. In contrast, YF 17D caused mortality
in a dose-dependent fashion, as expected, with an IC LD50 of 0.44 log PFU (Fig. 2). Based on IC LD values,
10 50
CYZ viruses (IC LD > 4 log PFU) are more than 3,500 times less neurovirulent in this model compared to the
50 10
YF 17D benchmark (P = 0.012; Mann Whitney test) and are as highly attenuated as ChimeriVax-JE.
A wt ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 strain was also used in this experiment. This virus has identical M and E protein
sequences to CYZ (French Polynesia-2013) and it has not been mouse-adapted by serial brain-to-brain passages.
It also caused low mortality (Fig. 2) and thus, this model is not optimal/applicable for the differentiation of LAVs
from at least some, e.g., mouse-brain un-adapted, wt ZIKV strains. It should be noted however that pathology
scores for CYZ viruses were lower than ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 based on observed clinical signs, specifically,
hunched posture, ruffled fur, weight loss and neurological manifestations (data not shown). On the contrary,
a highly mouse brain-adapted Uganda-1947 (MR766) ZIKV strain administered at a 4 log PFU dose caused
10
100% mortality in a neurovirulence test in 3.5-week old ICR mice, which are less susceptible to IC infection than
suckling mice (data not shown).
Immunogenicity of CYZ vaccine candidates was assessed in 3.5-week old ICR mice (8 animals per group) that
were immunized on days 0 and 28 by the intra peritoneal (IP) route with 5 log PFU of CYZ-yfs and CYZ-hs

was shown previously to not infect immunocompetent mice efficiently33 and thus we did not know whether CYZ
and ZIKV controls would infect ICR mice to elicit a detectable immune response after one dose]. Neutralizing
antibody responses were assessed after each dose to evaluate whether CYZ variants and other viruses would be
immunogenic in ICR mice after one/two doses. All animals remained healthy throughout the study. After the first
dose (Day 27), sera of mice immunized with CYZ variants and control chimeras displayed robust ZIKV-specific
neutralizing antibody (N Ab) titers determined against both Puerto Rico-2015 and Uganda-1947 (MR766) ZIKV
strains (PRNT GMTs 1282–7389 which were not statistically different against the two ZIKV strains; P > 0.5 by
50
one-way ANOVA) (Table 1), with the CYZ-hs variant notably being the most immunogenic. wt ZIKV strains
elicited variable N Ab titers which did not appear to correlate with their geographical location or year of isolation,
or whether they were mouse-adapted (Table 1). After the second dose (Day 49), NAb GMTs increased to ≥10,000
in most groups, with the exception of sera from CYZ-yfs immunized mice titrated against ZIKV Uganda-1947
(GMT 2,000) and sera from ZIKV Uganda-1947 immunized mice titrated against ZIKV Puerto Rico-2016 (GMT
1,047).
To evaluate the protective efficacy conferred by CYZ immunization, a pilot experiment was performed in
naïve ICR mice to establish a ZIKV challenge model. Approximately 6-month old ICR mice were inoculated
by the intravenous (IV) route with 2 log PFU of either Uganda-1947 (MR766) or Puerto Rico-2015 wt ZIKV
10
strains. Viremia was measured in sera on Days 1, 2, and 5 post-inoculation. Interestingly, despite the fact that
the Uganda-1947 (MR766) strain is highly mouse-adapted, no animals that received this virus showed viremia
detectable by RT-qPCR. In contrast, 4 out of 5 mice that received the Puerto Rico-2015 strain showed detectable
viremia (viral RNA) on Days 1 and 2 in the range of 1.1 × 103 to 2.8 × 104 genome equivalents (GE)/ml. In order
to assess the protection mediated by CYZ, ICR mice that were immunized with 2 doses of CYZ-hs variant were

viremia was detected by RT-PCR in CYZ-hs immunized animals indicative of a long-term protection, while 3
out of 6 mock-immunized mice developed viremia detected on Days 1–3 after challenge at titers up to 5.9 × 103
GE/ml.
CYZ attenuation, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in IFN-α/β receptor-deficient A129
mice following peripheral inoculation. A129 mice are an established, highly sensitive model for ZIKV
viscerotropism and have been shown to succumb to ZIKV disease in an age-dependent fashion. Specifically, 100%
mortality has been documented in 3-week old A129 mice, while 5-week old mice were partially susceptible and
all 11-week old mice studied survived peripheral ZIKV infection33. ZIKV was also demonstrated to elicit a robust
N Ab response in A129 mice16. Therefore, we used A129 mice to evaluate the attenuation, immunogenicity and
efficacy of CYZ-hs candidate.
To measure peripheral virulence, young 3-4-week old A129 mice received 5 log PFU of CYZ-hs variant,
10
ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 or YF 17D by the subcutaneous (SC) route. ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 induced neurologi-
cal signs of infection, a significant reduction in body weight (Fig. 3A) and 87.5% mortality (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
CYZ-hs virus was found to be highly attenuated as no weight loss, sickness or deaths were observed, as was seen
in the mock-infected control group. YF 17D was also found to be highly attenuated in this model [differences
between the ZIKV vs. all other groups were statistically significant, P = 0.0002 by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test]
(Fig. 3).
Tissue tropism (biodistribution), which is another measure of attenuation, as well as immunogenicity and pro-
tective efficacy of vaccine candidates, were examined in older, 8-week old A129 mice. Following SC inoculation of
animals (both males and females) with 5 log PFU of CYZ-hs or ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015, viral RNA loads were
10
determined on Days 5 and 26 in the spleen, liver, brain and testicles (of males) using RT-qPCR in 3 animals per
group/time point. On Day 5, high viral loads of ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 were observed in all of these organs, with
RNA concentrations of ~4.5–6.5 log GE/mg of tissues obtained. In contrast, CYZ-hs was significantly attenuated
10
as viral loads were ~2.5 orders of magnitude lower in the spleen, liver and testicles, and importantly, no CYZ-hs
virus was detected in the brain (Fig. 3C). On Day 26, ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 was detectable in all the organs,
with particularly high RNA loads in testes and brain (~6 and 4 log GE/mg, respectively), while CYZ-hs RNA
10
was only detectable at low concentration in the spleen (Fig. 3D). Differences in CYZ-hs and ZIKV RNA loads
were statistically significant on both days (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). All mice remained healthy throughout
this experiment.

In the inoculated 8-week old A129 mice, one dose of CYZ-hs variant elicited high N Ab responses measured
in sera on Day 26 against both Puerto Rico-2015 and MR766 ZIKV strains (PRNT GMTs 1,354 and 2,995,
50
respectively) (Table 2). Immunogenicity of CYZ-hs was comparable to that of the Puerto Rico-2015 virus.
Immunogenicity of CYZ-dg and CYZ-dC variants with additional attenuating genetic modifications (with
de-glycosylated E and 3-amino acid deletion in C, respectively) were also examined in this experiment. The
modifications reduced neutralizing titers several-fold compared to CYZ-hs, although the variants remained
rather immunogenic, with PRNT titers in the hundreds and considered to be at protective levels (Table 2).
50
The titers determined against the two ZIKV strains were not statistically different in all groups (P > 0.5;
one-way ANOVA).
To assess protection, mice were challenged SC on Day 31 with 3 log PFU of wt ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015.
10
Post-challenge viremia (viral RNA) was measured by RT-qPCR in sera collected on Days 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9.
CYZ-immunized animals were protected as only very low RNA levels were detectable in some animals, which
was not unexpected given the high sensitivity of RT-qPCR that could allow for detection of non-infectious (neu-
tralized) viral particles, including from the challenge inoculate. In contrast, high post-challenge viremia was
observed in mock-immunized controls peaking at ~7 log GE/ml on Day 5 (for Mock vs. CYZ groups on Days
10
3–9, P = 0.0002 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 4).
CYZ attenuation in vitro in human neuronal cell culture models. Attenuation in human neuronal
cells was evaluated by comparing growth curves of CYZ-yfs and CYZ-hs and ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 and
Uganda-1947 strains, as well as YF17D, in human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) and human neuronal progenitor
cell (hNPC) cultures at MOI 0.01 PFU/cell. The wt ZIKV strains grew efficiently in both hNPCs and neuro-
blastoma cells reaching peak titers of ~7 to >8 log PFU/ml (Fig. 5A and B, respectively). The YF 17D control
10
was significantly attenuated compared to ZIKV for replication in hNPCs but not in neuroblastoma cells. Both
CYZ-yfs and CYZ-hs variants exhibited a significant, ~100- and 40-fold reduction in peak titers in hNPCs and
neuroblastoma cultures, respectively, compared to wt ZIKVs (Fig. 5). No significant differences in the induction
of cytopathic effect (CPE) by the viruses were observed in both cell lines.

Discussion
In this study, we applied the ChimeriVax approach to the development of a chimeric LAV candidate vaccine
against Zika. The main advantage of LAVs is that they offer the possibility of enabling durable protection after a
single dose without any adjuvant, similar to the empirically attenuated YF 17D vaccine. The development of an
empirically attenuated ZIKV-based vaccine is not considered practical because of the unique features of ZIKV
replication and pathology in humans, particularly the congenital Zika syndrome (microcephaly and other ter-
atogenic effects) and sexual transmission, and the difficulty to establish reliable translational models to ensure
safety of empirical LAV candidates, e.g. for the fetus in pregnant women. The ChimeriVax approach is one of the
rational LAV approaches to a Zika vaccine that are currently being pursued (e.g.16,17,34).
While the main focus of this study was on the development of a Zika vaccine, our experiments yielded inter-
esting information on flavivirus molecular biology, specifically the effect of C/prM signalase cleavage on virus
replication. It has been proposed that a relatively inefficient signalase cleavage at this junction (downstream from
a viral protease cleavage in C) facilitates the incorporation of nucleocapsid during virus budding and thus is an
important prerequisite for efficient replication of flaviviruses. Enhancement of this cleavage in YF 17D was shown
to abrogate replication20–22. In ZIKV however, the C/prM signalase cleavage predicted score is rather high in com-
parison to YF 17D. Furthermore, increasing the cleavage probability by replacing the YF 17D specific prM signal
in CYZ-yfs chimera with a hybrid YF 17D/ZIKV prM signal unexpectedly resulted in a CYZ-hs variant which
replicated more efficiently than CYZ-yfs in Vero cells. This indicates that the requirement for inefficient prM
signalase cleavage is not necessarily true for all flaviviruses. However, the predicted cleavage efficiencies should
be confirmed experimentally in further studies.
The CYZ-hs variant grew to the highest titers in Vero cells among other variants (e.g., over 8 log PFU/ml at
10
MOI 0.001 PFU/cell) which is an important consideration for commercial manufacturing. For this reason, as well
as its favorable attenuation profile and the observation that it elicited the highest immune responses in mice, we
selected CYZ-hs as the lead vaccine candidate.
To ensure safety of flavivirus LAVs, neurovirulence in mice and non-human primates (NHP) should not
exceed that of YF 17D virus which is used as a standard benchmark comparator. YF 17D is neurovirulent for
immunocompetent mice, while the previously constructed ChimeriVax-JE, -WN and -DEN types 1–4 vaccines
were shown to not be neurovirulent in adult mice, although a degree of dose- and age-dependent neuroviru-
lence was observed in the more sensitive suckling mice at IC doses several orders of magnitude higher than YF
17D9,11,23,32. In 5-day old immunocompetent (ICR) suckling mice, IC inoculation with CYZ-hs resulted in few
deaths and observed clinical signs (similar to ChimeriVax-JE control), with the IC LD > 4 log PFU, and the
50 10
chimera was more than 3,500 times less neurovirulent than YF 17D (IC LD of 0.44 log PFU), thus satisfying
50 10
the requirement of being highly attenuated in this standard assay. However, this test was not suitable to clearly
differentiate CYZ-hs from a mouse-unadapted ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 control that also caused low mortality.
This result was not unexpected as most wt ZIKV isolates are not neurovirulent in mice unless they are mouse
brain-adapted by serial brain-to-brain passages35. For instance, we have found that the mouse brain-adapted
Uganda-1947 strain was lethal in 3.5-week old ICR mice (100% mortality at IC 4 log PFU dose).
10
A more clear differentiation of CYZ-hs (and CYZ-yfs) versus wt ZIKV with respect to replication in neu-
ronal cells was obtained by comparing viral growth in vitro using human neuroblastoma and hNPC cultures.
Replication in neuroblastoma cells is considered to be a predictor of pathology/attenuation of neurotropic
flaviviruses36,37, and hNPCs and hNPC-derived cerebral organoids have been developed as models for stud-
ying ZIKV-induced pathology in the developing human brain38–40. The significant reduction in CYZ replica-
tion observed in these cells (40-100-fold lower peak titers) in comparison to both ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 and
Uganda-1947 strains is indicative of a significant attenuation of CYZ candidates for replication in human brain
tissue. A reduced replication in the brain would reduce the risk of neuropathological adverse events after vacci-
nation of adults and children and possibly brain abnormalities in the fetus of vaccinated pregnant women, and is
thus a highly desirable characteristic in a Zika LAV.

Upon peripheral inoculation, wt ZIKV strains replicate in various organs and can cause disease in IFN
receptor-deficient mice (A129, AG129, Ifnar) in a dose and mouse-strain and age-dependent fashion33,41,42.
These mouse strains have been used in studies of attenuation/pathogenesis of other flaviviruses, e.g., YF 17D
vaccine and dengue viruses43,44. Therefore, we further evaluated attenuation of the CYZ-hs variant in IFN-α/β
receptor-deficient A129 mice following SC inoculation. CYZ-hs caused no signs of disease and no mortality in
young (3–4 week old) A129 mice, which are susceptible to wt ZIKV33. This was in contrast to wt ZIKV Puerto
Rico-2015 strain which induced clinical signs, weight loss and high mortality. Next, biodistribution was exam-
ined in older (8 week old) A129 mice. High levels of ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 viral RNA (~4.5–6.5 GE/mg) were
observed on Day 5 after SC infection in the spleen, liver, brain and testicles, while CYZ-hs RNA loads were at least
2.5 orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, in contrast to CYZ-hs, ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015 persisted, particularly
in testicles and the brain, as evidenced by high RNA concentrations in these organs on Day 26. Thus CYZ-hs is
highly attenuated for virulence and replication in organs in this model. The absence of CYZ-hs in testicles on
Day 26 indicates that the chimera has lost the ability for long-term persistence in this organ, a feature that would
reduce the risk of sexual transmission of CYZ vaccine virus after vaccination. Importantly, CYZ is not neu-
roinvasive as evidenced by the absence of viral RNA in the brain of mice on both Days 5 and 26. The absence of
neuroinvasion is an important safety feature for all target populations for vaccine use, including adults and pedi-
atric populations, and likely for vaccination of pregnant women. These data suggest that the NS proteins of the
non-neuroinvasive YF 17D virus rendered the chimera unable to penetrate the brain in this model, as well as to
persist in testes. A similar effect on neuroinvasiveness of NS proteins of a non-neuroinvasive virus was previously
documented for a chimeric dengue 4/TBE LAV in that its wt TBE parent virus (donor of the prM-E genes) was
lethal for mice after peripheral inoculation, while the chimera based on the backbone of the non-neuroinvasive
dengue type 4 virus was not45. Our data in this study also suggest that NS proteins of ZIKV play a significant role
in ZIKV tissue tropism/pathology.
Finally, a single dose of CYZ-hs was shown to be highly immunogenic in ICR and A129 mice, with PRNT
50
titers in sera (GMTs) ranging from ~1,300 to 7,000. For comparison, it was observed earlier that Balb/c mice
immunized with an inactivated Zika vaccine candidate with alum adjuvant developed N Ab titers of 15 as deter-
mined by micro-neutralization assay (albeit the values should be compared with caution due to differences in
the assays used). This level of N Abs was sufficient to protect animals from surrogate challenge with ZIKV by
the IV route13. Importantly, neutralizing titers in CYZ-immunized animals were equivalent when determined
against both the recent American (Puerto-Rico-2015) and original African (Uganda-1947) isolates indicating
that the CYZ vaccine is likely to be broadly protective against genetically distant ZIKV strains circulating in
different geographical regions. Both ICR and A129 immunized mice were protected from challenge with ZIKV
based on measuring viral RNA in post-challenge sera. ICR mice were protected from challenge at 7 months
post-immunization suggesting that CYZ can provide durable protection.
The evidence described here indicates that the lead CYZ-hs candidate is highly attenuated while maintain-
ing strong immunogenicity and ability to replicate efficiently in Vero cells. Taken together, these data support
further studies in other models, including NHP, and suggest that the vaccine may be suitable for evaluation in
human clinical trials and for commercial scale manufacturing. Standard NHP models used previously for other
ChimeriVax vaccines should be largely sufficient to generate additional necessary preclinical evidence of safety
and effectiveness of this LAV for adults (excluding pregnant women) and adolescents before they are sexually
active. For sexually active adults, additional preclinical or clinical models may need to be applied to ascertain that
there is no sexual transmission of a CYZ vaccine. Recently, a theoretical concern of enhancement of ZIKV infec-
tion or pathology by pre-existing antibodies against other flaviviruses was raised based on experiments in vitro
and in small animals. There is no evidence of such enhancement occurring in humans and the available NHP data
argue otherwise46,47. Nevertheless it may be necessary to demonstrate clinically that there is no enhancement of
CYZ vaccine infection by cross-reactive anti-flavivirus antibodies and thus, that vaccine safety would not be com-
promised in pre-immune subjects. Finally, if the intended target population will include pregnant women, safety
of a CYZ vaccine for the fetus will need to be demonstrated, preferably in an appropriate, reliable NHP model.
Materials and Methods
wt ZIKV strains and control vaccine viruses. The wt ZIKV strains used in this study were: MR766
(Uganda-1947), I-44 (Mexico-2016), FSS 13025 (Cambodia-2010), and DAK AR 41519 (Senegal-1984) obtained
from Dr. Robert Tesh, World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA, UTMB,
Galveston, TX), and PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico-2015) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC,
Atlanta, GA). Viruses were propagated and titrated similarly to CYZ chimeras as described below. ChimeriVax-JE
chimera was described previously32.
Construction and in vitro characterization of CYZ variants. Insertion of ZIKV prM-E genes (French
Polynesia-2013 strain; GenBank accession number KJ776791) into the YF 17D backbone in a low-copy num-
ber pBeloBac11-based single-plasmid vector48 and other genetic modifications were done using gene synthesis
(by DNA2.0, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, or gene blocks by Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL) and standard
cloning approaches. The prM-E genes from representative Asian (Cambodia-2010, GenBank accession number
JN860885) and African (Senegal-1984, GenBank accession number HQ234501) ZIKV strains were also used for
construction of control chimeras.
Resulting plasmids were linearized with the restriction enzyme XhoI and in vitro transcribed using Amplicap
SP6 High Yield Message Maker kits (Cellscript, Madison, WI). In vitro transcribed RNA was then transfected into
Vero cells to generate CYZ infectious viruses. All viral recoveries, further passages and growth curve analyses
in Vero cells were performed using serum free VPSFM medium (11681–020; Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA) at 37 °C, 5.0% CO . Virus stocks were supplemented with 10% sorbitol and stored at −80 °C.

Titers of viruses were determined in Vero cells either using a standard plaque assay on Day 5 post-infection
with crystal violet staining24,32 or by immunostaining of foci as previously described49 with anti-ZIKV E protein
MAb 0502156 (Aalto Bioreagents, Dublin, Ireland) and anti-mouse IgG Fc-HRP conjugated secondary antibody
(31437; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Genetic stability was confirmed by serial passage in Vero cells
to passage 5 (P5) at controlled MOIs of 0.01–0.001 PFU/cell followed by RT-PCR and consensus sequencing of
the prM-E genes and additional regions of the genome where needed, such as the C gene and 3′UTR of variants
with modifications in these elements, or full genomes.
Attenuation of CYZ replication in human neuronal cells was assessed in vitro by analyzing growth curves in
human neuroblastoma and hNPC cells and compared to wt ZIKV and YF 17D controls. Human SK-N-SH neuro-
blastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection/ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in ATCC-formulated
Eagle’s MEM (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS. hNPCs (ATCC) were grown in DMEM F12 medium with
Neural Progenitor Cell Expansion kit supplements (ATCC). Cells grown in T-25 flasks or 6-well tissue culture
plates (in the case of hNPCs) were infected with viruses at indicated MOIs and incubated at 37 °C, 5.0% CO.
2
Virus titers were determined in aliquots of media harvested daily.
Mouse studies. All procedures were performed under approved IACUC protocols in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health requirements for humane treatment of laboratory animals. Inoculation routes/doses,
and procedure days were as described in Results.
Mouse neurovirulence tests. Immunocompetent (ICR) mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles
River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington MA, USA). 5-day-old suckling mice, in groups of 9 to 12 (1
dam per group; suckling mice randomized between groups) were inoculated by the IC route with wt ZIKV, CYZ,
LAV and mock control at the indicated doses in 20 μl of MEM containing 0.25% human serum albumin using a
0.5-ml Hamilton Syringe and 27G ¼” microneedles. Inoculated mice were observed for 3 weeks for symptoms
of encephalitis, including ruffled hair, hunched back, paralysis, and death. Moribund animals were humanely
euthanized.
Evaluation of immunogenicity in immunocompetent mice, and attenuation and immunogenic-
ity in immunodeficient A129 mice. 3.5-week-old ICR mice were immunized twice (Days 0 and 28) by the
IP route with the indicated test articles and controls (8 animals per group). ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody
titers were determined after both the first and second doses (Days 27 and 53) in heat-inactivated serum samples
using a standard PRNT assay49 against wt ZIKV strains Puerto Rico-2015 and Uganda-1947 (MR766). Animals
50
were challenged by the IV route at ~7 months post-immunization with 2 log PFU Puerto Rico-2015 ZIKV and
10
post-challenge viremia was measured in serum on Days 1–5 by RT-qPCR using primers/probe specific for the
ZIKV E gene.
To measure attenuation in immunodeficient mice, 3-4-week old A129 mice (IFN-α/β receptor deficient;
Marshall BioResources, North Rose, NY, USA), which are susceptible to ZIKV, were inoculated with 5 log PFU
10
of CYZ or indicated control viruses by the SC route followed by observation of neurological signs of infection,
weight loss and mortality.
To assess tissue tropism as well as immunogenicity and protective efficacy, older, 8-week old A129 mice (both
males and females) were inoculated SC with CYZ and control viruses. Biodistribution was determined on Days
5 and 26 by measuring viral RNA loads in the spleen, liver, brain and testicles using RT-qPCR in 3 animals per
group/time point. ZIKV-specific antibody responses were measured in sera on Day 26 by PRNT . Animals were
50
challenged SC on Day 31 with 3 log PFU of wt ZIKV Puerto Rico-2015. Post challenge viremia was measured by
10
RT-qPCR in sera collected on Days 1–9.
Statistical analyses. Calculations of endpoint titers and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 6 (GraphPad Prism Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).
