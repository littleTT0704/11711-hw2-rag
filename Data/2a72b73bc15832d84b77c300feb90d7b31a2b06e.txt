1 Topical overview
Knowledge graphs are an effective way to store semantics in a structured format that is eas-
ily used by computer systems. In the past few decades, work across different research com-
munities led to scalable knowledge acquisition techniques for building large-scale knowl-
edge graphs. The result is the emergence of large publicly available knowledge graphs
(KGs) such as DBpedia (Lehmann et al. 2014), Freebase (Bollacker et al. 2008), and oth-
ers. While knowledge graphs are designed to support a wide set of different applications,
this special issue focuses on the use case of text retrieval and analysis.
Utilizing knowledge graphs for text analysis requires effective alignment techniques that
associate segments of unstructured text with entries in the knowledge graph, for example
using entity extraction and linking algorithms (Carmel et al. 2014; Mendes et al. 2011;
Blanco et al. 2015). A wide range of approaches that combine query-document represen-
tations and machine learning repeatedly demonstrate significant improvements for such
tasks across diverse domains (Dalton et al. 2014; Liu and Fang 2015; Hasibi et al. 2015;
Xiong and Callan 2015; Raviv et al. 2016; Ensan and Bagheri 2017; Xiong et al. 2017).
The goal of this special issue is to summarize recent progress in research and practice in

for text retrieval and analysis applications. The scope includes acquisition, alignment, and
utilization of knowledge graphs and other semantic resources for the purpose of optimizing
end-to-end performance of information retrieval systems.
2 A rticles in this special issue
Extraction errors, missing relations, and yet unobserved entity-facts lead to never-complete
knowledge graphs. Entity linking and missing link prediction methods make use of entity
set expansion as an underlying component. Rastogi et al. (2018) suggest a neural auto-
encoder framework for entity set expansion, which particularly excels in difficult situations
when entities appear in multiple sentences and many entities are contained in the query.
For similar reasons, large knowledge graphs are undergo continuous improvement cycles.
With the increased coverage of entities and facts it is likely that the ontological type struc-
ture needs to be modified. To compare and assess different versions of an evolving knowl-
edge graph, Nayak et al. (2018) develop a similarity measure for knowledge hierarchies.
Several works focus on search queries that ask for entities. Garigliotti et al. (2018) focus
on how to best exploit type information that is present queries for entity retrieval. Different
approaches to matching type information to entities are explored ranging between top-level
types and most specific types in the hierarchy.
Sawant et al. (2019) develop a method to exploit entity mentions and type hints to rea-
son about the target entity. The approach combines information from a knowledge graph
with information from a full text corpus with entity link annotations. These heterogeneous
pieces of information are integrated through multiple convolutional networks to gracefully
handle cases where exact word matches fail.
Jimmy et al. (2018) explore KG-aware retrieval models in the context of consumer
health search. A key challenge of the consumer health domain is the vocabulary mismatch
problem. To this end, Jimmy et al. (2018) using knowledge graphs to match consumer que-
ries to the medical terminology used in documents.
Addressing the population of knowledge graphs with text, where each entity is asso-
ciated with several facets (i.e., headings on Wikipedia pages), MacAvaney et al. (2018)
suggest an approach for identifying relevant text passages. Where a traditional informa-
tion retrieval approach would include such facets into the keyword query, MacAvaney et al.
(2018) address the problem of low-utility facets, these are frequent headings whose words
are unlikely to appear in relevant passages.
These six contributions discuss important aspects that arise when knowledge graphs are
populated and used in the context of information retrieval. Each of them makes a strong
case for integrating unstructured text and structured knowledge across a wide range of
domains and applications.
