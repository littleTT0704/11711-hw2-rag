 NuggetOffset (discrete, per nugget):
Offset of the text nugget in its source document measured in nuggets. Text at
the beginning of a document is often more relevant.
• AvgTokenLength (continuous, per nugget):
Average length of the tokens in the nugget. Text in natural language on average
contains longer tokens than source code snippets and other character sequences
that are not useful for source expansion.
• TypeTokenRatio (continuous, per nugget):
Ratio of the number of distinct tokens over the total number of tokens in the
text nugget. Some nuggets have high topicality scores just because they repeat
topical terms over and over, but they provide little relevant information. This
feature is intended to favor nuggets that are less repetitive.
• SpecialCharacterRatio (continuous, per nugget):
Ratio of the number of special characters over the total number of characters
in the nugget. This feature penalizes nuggets that are not well-formed English
text, which often contain a large number of special characters.
• CapitalizationRatio (continuous, per nugget):
Ratio of the number of capital letters over the total number of characters in the
nugget. TextthatisnotinEnglishormalformedoftencontainsmoreupper-case
characters than well-formed English text.
• PunctuationRatio (continuous, per nugget):
Ratio of the number of punctuation marks over the total number of characters
in the text nugget. Natural English text contains fewer punctuation marks than
source code snippets, enumerations and other non-natural text.
The topicality features TopicRatioSeed, TFIDFSeed and CosineSim utilize the
body of the seed document, which provides useful information about the relevance of
related text that is not available in definitional QA or multi-document summarization
tasks. For features that rely on language models to estimate the topicality of text
nuggets(TopicRatioSeedandTopicRatioNuggets),weusesimpleunigramswithGood-
Turing discounting because often not much data is available to fit the topic models.
