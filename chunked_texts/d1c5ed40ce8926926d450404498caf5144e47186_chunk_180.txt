 or other term weighting schemes. We experimented
with different window sizes and found a value of n = 50 to be relatively effective.
However, the algorithm did not appear to be overly sensitive to the choice of this

The cosine similarities may depend on properties of the document, such as the
writingstyleandvocabularysize, andthustheirabsolutevaluesareoftenpoorindica-
torsfortransitionsbetweenrelevantandirrelevanttext. Inaddition, ifthesimilarities
are consistently low over a series of nugget boundaries, as illustrated in Figure 8.5 (b),
this does not necessarily imply that there is a transition between relevant and irrele-
vant text at each boundary, but it could also be indicative of an incoherent sequence
of irrelevant text. For instance, the front page of a news website may contain a list
of abstracts of unrelated news articles, or a discussion board may list the titles of
all current threads. Thus, it seems more prudent to compare the similarity value at
a given boundary to the similarities at nearby boundaries, and look for “valleys” in
the similarity scores. In Figure 8.5 (a) the depth of the valley at the i-th boundary
can be measured from the local maxima at i − 2 and i + 1. More formally, Hearst
proposes the following algorithm for computing the depth of the valley at the i-th
nugget boundary:
