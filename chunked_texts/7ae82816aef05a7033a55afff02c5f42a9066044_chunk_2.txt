Another aspect, which so far has received less attention, is the proper treat-

languages where the most important clues to syntactic functions are often found
in the morphology rather than in word order patterns. Thus, for a language like
Turkish,ithas beenshownthatparsingaccuracycanbe improvedbytakingmor-

In this paper, we study the role of lexicalization, morphological structure and

groups proposed by Eryig˘it and Oflazer [9] to a more traditional representation
based on word forms, we experiment with different ways of representing mor-
phological features in the input to the parser, and we compare lexicalized and
unlexicalized models to see how they interact with different representations of
morphologicalstructure and morphologicalfeatures.

an approach previously used for the analysis of Japanese [10], English [11, 12],
Swedish [13] and Czech [14]. In this way, our study complements that of Eryig˘it
and Oflazer [9], which considers dependency parsing of Turkish in a probabilistic
framework.

Turkishis aflexible constituentorderlanguage.Eventhoughinwritten texts,the
constituent order of sentences generally conforms to the SOV or OSV structures,
the constituents may freely change their position depending on the requirements
ofthe discoursecontext.Fromthe pointof view ofdependency structure,Turkish
is predominantly (but not exclusively) head final.
Turkish has a very rich agglutinative morphologicalstructure. Nouns can give

words may be formed through productive derivations, and it is not uncommon to
