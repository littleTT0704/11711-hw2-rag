0001) and the US (F(5,240)=10.521, p<0.0001) leaders’ messages were noted. The Tukey
post hoc test revealed that M1 was statistically significantly higher than M2 (p<0.0001), M3
(p<0.0001), M4 (p<0.0001), M5 (p<0.004) and M6 (p<0.0001) in Chinese leaders’ messages
(see Figure 3a). While for US leaders’ messages, M1 was statistically significantly higher than
M3 (p<0.0001), M4 (p<0.0001), M5 (p<0.0001) and M6 (p<0.0001). In addition, M2 was
statistically significantly higher than M3 (p=0.01) and M6 (p=0.006) (see Figure 3b).
The t-test results showed that there was a statistically significantly higher use of intertextuality
in M2, which is concerned with major values/mission and vision, in US leaders’ messages as
opposed to messages from corporations in the PRC (M =1.9706, M =4.0976, p=0.0004).

5. Discussion
5.1 Standardised linguistic manifestations of intertextuality in leader messages
Our study examined corporate leader messages based on two comparable data sets: one
collected from Global 500 corporations in the PRC and the other one from corporations in the
US. Despite noticeable differences in their linguistic and cultural backgrounds, some similar
patterns of manifestations of intertextuality were evident in the two countries. As “genres tend
to have their own intertextual patterns that reflect the type of social action that the genre
participate in” (Koskela, 2013), the striking similarities across the leader messages from
different cultural backgrounds indicate the existence of a corporate leader message genre and
the importance of leaders’ roles in realising the communicative goals of the corporation. The
use of T3 or indirect speech shows the common use of attribution, an interpersonal
metadiscourse that “draw on external sources to underline
