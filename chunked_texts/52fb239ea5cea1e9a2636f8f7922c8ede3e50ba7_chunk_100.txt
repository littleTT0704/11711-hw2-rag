Question: A gardener is going to plant 2 red rosebushes and 2 white rosebushes. If
thegardeneristoselecteachofthebushesatrandom,oneatatime,andplantthem
in a row, what is the probability that the 2 rosebushes in the middle of the row will
be the red rosebushes?
Options: {A:1/12, B:1/6, C:1/5, D:1/3, E:1/2}
Answer: B
Explanation: We are asked to find the probability of one particular pattern: wrrw.
Total# of ways a gardener can plant these fourbushes is the #of permutations of4
letters wwrr, out of which 2 w’ s and 2 r’ s are identical, so 4! / 2! 2! = 6 ; so p =
1 / 6. Answer: B.
Program: import scipy
n0 = 2.0
n1 = 2.0
n2 = 2.0
t0 = n0 + n0
t1 = scipy.special.comb(t0, n0)
answer = 1.0 / t1
