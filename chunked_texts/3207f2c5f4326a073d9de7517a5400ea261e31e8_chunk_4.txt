two key findings from this effort are summarized in Table 2.
First, it was found that the N1 position showed very steep

the 4-thiazolyl group generally providing the most active

was shown to be very permissive to structural changes and we
were quickly able to improve antiviral potency to the
submicromolar range through introduction of more lipophilic
substituents (cf. compounds 1 and 6−9 or compounds 2 and
10). Another early observation was that the poor metabolic aHalf maximal effect concentration measured by cytopathic effect for
