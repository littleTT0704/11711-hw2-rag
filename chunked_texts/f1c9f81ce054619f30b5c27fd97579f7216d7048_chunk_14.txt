RLT-DiMP and SuperDimp indicate our final version and baseline version, re-
spectively. In this section, we compare performance by adding one proposed
module each from the baseline.

tobaseline,theF-scoreisimprovedby0.025,0.031,and0.018.Accordingly,these
results prove that our sub-algorithms enable our tracker to estimate the target
position more robustly. We note that our RLT-DiMP method outperforms the
F-score by 0.038 compared to the baseline tracker.
In the visual attribute analysis, the proposed method surpasses the baseline
tracker
