J.1.ReasoningaboutColoredObjects
# Q: On the table, you see a bunch of objects arranged in a row: a purple paperclip,
a pink stress ball, a brown keychain, a green scrunchiephone charger, a mauve
fidget spinner, and a burgundy pen. What is the color of the object directly to
the right of the stress ball?
# Put objects into a list to record ordering
objects = []
objects += [('paperclip', 'purple')] * 1
objects += [('stress ball', 'pink')] * 1
objects += [('keychain', 'brown')] * 1
objects += [('scrunchiephone charger', 'green')] * 1
objects += [('fidget spinner','mauve')] * 1
objects += [('pen', 'burgundy')] * 1
# Find the index of the stress ball
stress_ball_idx = None
for i, object in enumerate(objects):
if object[0] =='stress ball':
stress_ball_idx = i
break
# Find the directly right object
direct_right = objects[stress_ball_idx+1]
# Check the directly right object's color
direct_right_color = direct_right[1]
