where we define ∆(θ) as the characteristic function We now discuss in depth why ∆(θ y) > 0 is able
for large angular margin. ∆(θ) determines most of the to introduce large angular margin. For ease of illustra-
tion, we consider the binary case where the first class
properties about theangular margin, such as thesize of
is the target class. In this case, we only need to discuss
themargin,itslearningstability,etc.
