learning.
Online learning. We also perform background augmentation during tracking
intheonlinestageassameasinthefirstframe.However,thisprocessisonlyused
when the reliability of the bounding box is high since the estimated bounding
box is not always confident. The background augmentation process is the same
as the first frame one, and the filter is trained if more demanding conditions are
met.Unlikeinthefirstframesettings,imageswithbackgroundaugmentationare
not stored in memory. This prevents the problem of including negative features
that cause drifting to other objects.
3.5 Confidence Score Assignment
The baseline short-term tracker classifies the state of object tracking into four
typesaccordingtothescoreandvariousconditions:normal,hardnegative,uncer-
tain,andnot found.Inthecaseofnormal andhard negative,theobjecttracking
result is reliable, so the confidence score is given as 1. In the case of uncertain,
it is difficult to determine whether it is an object or not, so the confidence score
is given as 0.5. Lastly, in the case of not found, it is predicted that there is no
object, so the confidence score is given as 0.
4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset and Settings
Dataset We experiment with a long-term object tracking dataset, LTB50 [24].
ThisdatasetisanextensionoftheLTB35[24]usedintheVOT-LT2018challenge
[16], and it is officially used in the VOT-LT2019 [18] challenge. In the VOT-
LT2020 challenge, the LTB50 is used unchanged from last year. The LTB50
