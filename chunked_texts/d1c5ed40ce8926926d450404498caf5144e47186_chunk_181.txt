5. Set DepthR = CosSim(R) - CosSim(i)
6. Set CosSimDepth = DepthL + DepthR
This depth score based on cosine similarities was added as another TextTiling feature,
denoted CosSimDepth.
Hearst noted that small dips in the cosine similarity scores may result in local
maxima which can affect the computation of the depth scores. This behavior is illus-
trated by the example in Figure 8.5 (c), where the depth computation for boundary
i is interrupted by the small valley at i+2. To increase the robustness of the depth
feature to small perturbations in the similarity scores, Hearst proposes a smoothed
version of the cosine similarity, computed as follows:
i+s
1 (cid:88)
CosSimSmooth(i) = CosSim(j).
2s+1
j=iâˆ’s
The smoothing width s controls the amount of smoothing applied to the original
similarity scores. We added CosSimSmooth as a third TextTiling feature, using the
recommended parameter value of s = 1. Then, based on this feature, we computed
depth scores using the smoothed similarities, yielding a forth TextTiling feature de-
noted CosSimSmoothDepth.
Figure 8.6 shows the values of the TextTiling features for a portion of a web page
retrieved for the topic Iran-Iraq War. The values on the x-axis indicate whether a

text nugget is relevant (1) or irrelevant (0), and the y-axis gives the feature values for
the boundary between that text nugget and the previous nugget. The (abbreviated)
nugget text is shown in the table below the plot. The nugget boundaries were deter-
mined based on structural markup in HTML documents. For the features CosSim
and CosSimSmooth, a small value indicates a likely transition between relevant and
irrelevant nuggets, whereas for the features CosSimDepth and CosSimSmoothDepth
a large value is indicative of a transition. In this example, CosSimSmoothDepth per-
fectly predicts the transitions from irrelevant to relevant and back to irrelevant text.
However, it should be noted that this is
