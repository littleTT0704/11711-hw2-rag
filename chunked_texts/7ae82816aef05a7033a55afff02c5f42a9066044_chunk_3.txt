finduptofivederivationsfromasimpleroot.PreviousworkonTurkish,[15,16,9]
has represented the morphological structure of Turkish words by splitting them
intoinflectionalgroups(IG).Therootandderivedformsofawordarerepresented
by different IGs separatedfromeachother by derivationalboundaries.EachIG is
then annotatedwith its ownpart-of-speechandany inflectionalfeatures.Figure 1
shows the IGs in a simple sentence: “ku¨c¸u¨k odadayım” (I’m in the small room).
The word“odadayım”is formed fromtwo IGs;a verbis derivedfromaninflected
noun “odada” (in the room).
Dependency relations in a sentence always hold between the final IG of the
dependentwordandsomeIGofthe headword[16,9],soitisnotsufficienttojust
identify the words involved in a dependency relation, but the exact IGs. In the
example, the adjective “ku¨c¸u¨k” (small) should be connected to the first IG of the
second word. It is the word “oda” (room) which is modified by the adjective, not
the derived verb form “odadayım” (I’m in the room). So both the correct head
word and the correct IG in the head word should be determined by the parser.

3 Parsing Framework
Aprominentapproachto data-drivendependency parsingin recentyearsis based
on the combination of three techniques:
1. Deterministic parsing algorithms for building dependency graphs [10, 17]
2. History-based models for predicting the next parser action [18]
3. Discriminative classifiers to map histories to parser
