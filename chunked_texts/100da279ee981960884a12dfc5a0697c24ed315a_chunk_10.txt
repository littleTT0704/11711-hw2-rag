enrolledsamples. Ontheotherhand,alowthresholdsacrificesqualitybyfullyinvolvingmorebut

of the PMF from actual cases. Adaptive confidence thresholding (Zhang et al., 2021; Xu et al.,
2021b) adopts the dynamic and class-wise threshold, which alleviates the trade-off by evolving
the (class-wise) threshold during learning. They impose a further relaxation on the assumption of

While some methods indeed consider the definition of λ(p) (Ren et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021;
Kim et al., 2022), interestingly, they all neglect the assumption induced on the PMF. The lack of
