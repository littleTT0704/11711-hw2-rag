Coding procedure and intercoder reliability
One coder, a full-time research assistant, was comprehensively trained to undertake half
of the content coding of the apologies. The first author completed the other half of the coding.
To ensure consistency in the interpretation of the coding scheme of response strategies and
appraisal resources, both coders coded eight corporate apologies (40% of the total number of
apologies studied) to check on intercoder reliability. All disagreements were discussed prior
to the comprehensive implementation of the coding exercise. For all categories, the average
pairwise percent of agreement was greater than 0.88, and the average pairwise Cohenâ€™s
Kappa was greater than 0.8, indicating an almost perfect agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977;
Hallgren, 2012). See Appendix 3 for the summary of the IRR statistics of the coding items.
Findings and discussion
Regarding RQ1, our results were consistent with previous studies (e.g. Ngai & Jin, 2016;
Benoit, 2018; Holdener & Kauffman, 2014),
