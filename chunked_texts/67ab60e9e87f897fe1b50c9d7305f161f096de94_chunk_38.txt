Appendix A. Evaluation Tasks
Our 19 tasks were derived from 16 datasets, as described in more detail below. Tasks
described as “novel” are not comparable to the literature. A summary of task statistics is
available in Table 2.
Speech Commands (version 2), 5h and full Classification of known spoken com-
mands, with additional categories for silence and unknown commands (Warden, 2018). As
per the literature, models are evaluated by prediction accuracy. We also provide a 5-hour
subset of the training data. We use the predefined train and test split, and note that the
test data has a different distribution of labels from the training data.
NSynth Pitch, 5h and 50h NSynth Pitch is a novel multiclass classification prob-
lem. The goal of this task is to classify instrumental sounds from the NSynth Dataset
(Engel et al., 2017) into one of 88 pitches. Results for this task are measured by pitch
accuracy, as well as chroma accuracy. Chroma accuracy considers only the pitch “class”
