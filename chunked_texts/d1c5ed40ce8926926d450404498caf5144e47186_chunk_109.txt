and chose parameter values that resulted in reasonable cutoff points. That is, with
these parameters the final pseudo-documents contained a large number of relevant
text nuggets but little noise. Later we also performed QA experiments using different
parameter settings and found that the precise thresholds have very little impact on
QA performance. In general, more lenient thresholds yield slightly better results at
the expense of larger expanded sources and thus longer QA response times.
We extracted paragraph-length text nuggets from web pages based on HTML
markup and scored them using a logistic regression model with features of adjacent
instances, trained on all labeled data. Overall, the SE system processed about 40 mil-
lion web pages, totaling about 2 TB of web data (including markup) and 4 billion
text nuggets. The expansion of each seed document took around 15â€“45 seconds and
most of this time was spent on the retrieval of web pages from different hosts. These
numbers illustrate that a highly efficient and robust implementation is required. The
sizes of the seed corpora and expanded sources are given in Table 6.3. The SE al-
gorithm condensed the web data by two orders of magnitude, yielding a corpus that
