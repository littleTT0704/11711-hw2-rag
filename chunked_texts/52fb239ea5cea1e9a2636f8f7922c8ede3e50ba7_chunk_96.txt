to obtain augmentations for all templates across all datasets. To familiarize
workers with the intended style of each template, we provide 3 demonstrative
augmentations within the instructions of each HIT, as summarized in Table
16. We restrict our crowdsourcing pipeline to workers that had above a 98%
acceptance rate with over 1000 completed HITs. We provide workers with an
upper bound of 1 hour to complete each HIT but specify in the instructions that
each HIT should feasible be completed in 10 minutes. Based on minimum wage
policies and under the assumption that workers follow the 10-minute completion
guideline, we accordingly compensate $3 per HIT. Finally, to ensure dataset
quality of generations via the Amazon Mechanical Turk Fort et al. (2011); Adda
et al. (2011), we manually assess the worker augmentations produced for each
template.
C Dataset Statistics
Figure 8 gives relatives sizes of tasks within each category. Figure 9 illustrates
the unigram frequencies in L¯ila, where larger words indicate higher frequency.
Table 17 gives comprehensive statistics on each task. Table 19 cites each
component dataset of L¯ila.
D Additional Results
Table 18 gives the unaggregated performance of each model on each dataset in
L¯ila (some datasets are split across tasks).
