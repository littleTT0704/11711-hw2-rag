can be widely used in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles [20],
robotics[29],andvideosurveillancesystems[1].Withtheadvanceofdeeplearn-
ing techniques, trackers are not only getting better performance but also used
at long-term tracking (minute-level) beyond short-term tracking (second-level).

Besides the length of input videos, the clear difference between short-term
trackingandlong-termtrackingiswhetherthetargetexistsinthefieldofview,as
reflectedinstandardbenchmarkdatasets[33,25].Ingeneral,short-termtrackers
are designed on the assumption that the target always appears in every single
frame, otherwise, the short-term tracker will drift and fail. Long-term trackers,
ontheotherhand,needtokeeptrackoftheobjectevenifitdisappearsfromthe
fieldofviewinthemiddleoftheframes.Consequently,there-detectionmodule,
which localizes the target with a confidence score of its absence, is the essential
part of long-term trackers.
Because long-term trackers encounter unpredictable abrupt changes during
relativelylongsequences,therobustnessisthemostimportantpropertyoflong-
term trackers. If the long-term tracker misestimates the location of a target
because of visual deformation, there is a high risk of incorrect estimation in
the following frame. Previous researches tried to construct robust modules and
strategiesinvariouswayssuchasP-Nlearning[15],memorymodel[21],anddy-
namic programming [30]. Those methods are focusing on the robustness against
visual deformation.
Inthiswork,wefocusontherobustnessagainstthere-detectionmoduleitself
(i.e. reliability of the trackerâ€™s prediction) as well as against visual deformation.
First, we propose a way to reduce the uncertainty of our model and correct
