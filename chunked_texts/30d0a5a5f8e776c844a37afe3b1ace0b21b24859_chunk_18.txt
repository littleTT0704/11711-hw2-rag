ties into the agents. In the ObjectNav task, the object
detection task takes on a fundamental role. Still, the
agent does not have to remember all the objects (and
their semantic information) encountered in the past.
In MultiON, on the other hand, we assume a more
limitedpartofthedetection(e.g., detectingcylinders
orasetofalimitednumberofnaturalobjects). Paral-
lelly, the agent must be able to remember the objects
already seen. Thus, this task is more tailored to the
real world than ObjectNav. In fact, the agents oper-
