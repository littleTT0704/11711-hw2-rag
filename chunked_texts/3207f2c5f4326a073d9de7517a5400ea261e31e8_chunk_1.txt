ABSTRACT: A high-throughput screen based on a viral replication
assay was used to identify inhibitors of the human cytomegalovirus.

via direct cell-to-cell spread from infected to uninfected cells.
Preliminary structure−activity relationships demonstrated that the
potency of compound 1 could be improved to a low nanomolar level,
but metabolic stability was a key optimization parameter for this series.
AstrategyfocusedonminimizingmetabolichydrolysisoftheN1-amide
led to an alternative scaffold in this series with improved metabolic
stability and good pharmacokinetic parameters in rat.
