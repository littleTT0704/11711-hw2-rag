During rollout, any error in a state could create a setting that is out-of-distribution for the policy.
Thus, category token accuracy sets an upper bound for rollout performance, that is, while having

This especially penalizes policies that present a ‘looping’ behavior, such as repeatedly open/close

D AdditionalAblationExperiments
In Section 3.3, we presented ablation experiments over number of demonstrations per preference

ablation experiments over the design of instance encodings in TTP. Additionally, we also present
