8.2.3 Experimental Setup
The graphical model was evaluated and compared to linear relevance models on the
dataset introduced in Section 5.1. For each approach, we performed a 12-fold cross-
validation over the topics marked as CV in Table 5.1. The text nuggets for each topic
were assigned to a different fold to avoid training and testing on similar instances or
even duplicates. The nuggets were ranked by their relevance estimates in descending
order, and the rankings were evaluated using the same performance metrics as in the
evaluation of the baselines and linear models in Chapter 5: mean average precision
(MAP) and precision-recall curves.
We present evaluation results on both sentence-length text nuggets (Sentence)
and paragraph-length nuggets delimited by structural HTML markup (Markup) for
