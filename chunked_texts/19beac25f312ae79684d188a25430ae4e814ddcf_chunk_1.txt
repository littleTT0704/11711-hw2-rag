Abstract
Existing research on autonomous driving primarily fo-
cuses on urban driving, which is insufficient for charac-
terising the complex driving behaviour underlying high-
speed racing. At the same time, existing racing simula-
tionframeworksstruggleincapturingrealism,withrespect
to visual rendering, vehicular dynamics, and task objec-
tives, inhibiting the transfer of learning agents to real-
world contexts. We introduce a new environment, where
agentsLearn-to-Race(L2R)insimulatedcompetition-
style racing, using multimodal information—from virtual
cameras to a comprehensive array of inertial measure-
ment sensors. Our environment, which includes a sim-
ulator and an interfacing training framework, accurately
models vehicle dynamics and racing conditions. In this
paper, we release the Arrival simulator for autonomous
racing. Next, we propose the L2R task with challenging
metrics,inspiredbylearning-to-drivechallenges,Formula-
style racing, and multimodal trajectory prediction for au-
tonomousdriving. Additionally,weprovidetheL2Rframe-
work suite, facilitating simulated racing on high-precision
models of real-world tracks. Finally, we provide an offi-
cial L2R task
