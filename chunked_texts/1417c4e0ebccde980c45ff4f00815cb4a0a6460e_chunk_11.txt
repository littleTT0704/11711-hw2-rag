Based on this, we estimate the number of new infections on day t as
N
n˜dp(t)
(N/14)n˜ (t)
Zˆ (t)= n˜dn(t)c(t) = dp (9)
d 141+ n˜dp(t) c(t)n˜ dn(t)+n˜ dp(t)
n˜dn(t)c(t)
Intuition
The central assumption underlying our model is that infected individuals are more likely than uninfected
individuals to receive diagnostic tests. The parameter c(t) quantifies this bias toward testing SARS-CoV-2-
infected patients: large values of c(t) indicate a large preference for testing SARS-CoV-2-infected patients,
while a value of c(t)=1 indicates no prejudice between testing SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-SARS-CoV-
2-infected patients.
Estimating c(t)
To estimate the free parameter c(t), we use seroprevalence as a measure of Z(t) and calculate the implied
c(t). In contrast to the diagnostic tests, which have relied on patients seeking treatment for their disease,
representative seroprevalence studies attempt to get an unbiased view of a region by randomly selecting
participants and re-weighting demographic groups to reflect a broader population. Each study provides a
view of Z(t) which implies a particular c(t):
Nn˜ (t) n˜ (t)
cˆ(t)= p − p (10)
Z˜(t)n˜ n(t) n˜ n(t)
In Table 1, we show the value of cˆ(t) implied by the reported value of Z(t) in the following seroprevalence
studies:
