� to justify the failure to provide timely customer service.
The strategy of accident—which occurred infrequently—can be discursively constructed
by manipulating positive and negative appreciation, as illustrated in example 6.
(6) This matter is an unfortunate [negative Appreciation] exception to the outstanding
[positive Appreciation] service FedEx team members deliver every single day. (Apology
from Matthew Thornton III, Senior Vice President of US Operations FedEx Express,
2011)
When communicating the message that the courier’s delivery behavior is a rare case, the
Senior VP of FedEx uses the negative appreciation “unfortunate” to express his regret for the
incident while using positive appreciation “outstanding” to stress the shared evaluation of the
company’s service commitment to the public.
Simple denial rarely occurred in corporate apology discourse as it generates an
unfavorable impression of corporations regarding avoiding responsibility if used improperly.
Denial can be constructed via the use of engagement, as shown in example 7 below.
(7) Based on what we know [Heterogloss] now, there is no [Heterogloss] evidence that
banking, credit card, medical information (such as claims, test results, or diagnostic codes)

The CEO uses the heterogloss “know” to signal the shared expectations with
stakeholders that the investigation has been conducted, and the use of “no” indicates that the
crisis was not as severe as had been previously perceived.

Conclusion, Implications, and Limitations
As one of the first attempts to examine corporate leaders’ crisis communication through
the lens of the appraisal framework, this study’s findings advance our understanding of what
makes CEO apologies more acceptable with respect to the use of appropriate words or
linguistic devices for different crisis responses. Crisis leaders can be made more
knowledgeable of which linguistic resources to draw on to compose convincing apologies for
crisis management. For example, CEOs can utilize positive appreciation in attitude resources
to reduce hostility and rebuild corporate image, and negative appreciation to elicit empathy
and neutralize negative effects induced by the crisis.
Another noteworthy contribution of this research is that by categorizing all CEO crisis
response strategies into three approaches to reflect their distinct communicative goals—
namely Emphasizing Rem
