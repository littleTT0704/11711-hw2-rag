time to find objects in all areas.

stochastic point of view, it is possible to search the entire area within a few frames.
Random search. First, we create global searching templates with a predeter-
minedinterval.Next,weadaptivelydeterminethenumberofsearchesaccording
totheratiooftheimagesizetothetargetsize.Whenthetargetsizeisrelatively
large, we set the fewer number to search. Otherwise, we assign more numbers
to search when the target size is relatively small. Then, an object is detected
within a randomly selected searching area. As visualized in Fig. 3, it is possible

we note that this na¨ıve re-detection scheme is not robust. Figure 4 shows the

Once the target is missing, a new object can be re-detected immediately, even if
the new object is located far from the original target. However, the probability
of an object disappearing and suddenly appearing at a distant location is very
low. To prevent this sudden detection, we penalize a confidence score through
spatio-temporal constraints, which is expressed as follows:
