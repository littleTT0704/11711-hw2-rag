 Chinese leaders’ messages in comparison with that of the US messages (M =2.5882,
CN
M =0.0244, p<0.0001). Furthermore, a significant difference was noted with respect to the
US
presence of R3 (M =1.3529, M =3.0976, p<0.009) in US leader messages compared with
CN US
those of their Chinese counterparts (RQ2). Two-way ANOVA also confirmed an interaction
between country and intertextual types on R2 (F(4,365)=6.165, p<0.0001) and R3
(F(4,365)=3.732, p<0.005) (RQ2). The use of government policies reference in T2-direct quote
with reference, T3-indirect quote and T4-recognisable phrasing in messages from corporations
in the PRC was significantly higher when compared with the US messages. However, the use
of societal reference in T3-indirect quote and T4-recognisable phrasing of the US leaders’
messages was significantly higher than that of their Chinese counterparts.
4.3 Manifestation of intertextuality in the move structure
Concerning the third research question investigating the use of intertextuality in the move
structure of leaders’ messages from corporations in the US and PRC, our findings indicated
that the use of intertextuality in M1 (M=8.2647) was the most frequent followed by M5
(M=2.9706), M4 (M=1.9412), M2 (M=1.9706), M3 (M=0.6176) and M6 (M=0.5) in messages
from corporations in the PRC. Similarly, the use of intertextuality in M1 (M=6.4146) was most
27
commonly seen followed by M2 (M=4.0976), M5 (M=1.3171), M4 (M=1.1951), M3
(M=0.4878) and M6 (M=0.3171) in messages from corporations in the US.
Significant differences in the use of intertextuality in M1 in both Chinese (F(5,198)=7.857,
p<0.
