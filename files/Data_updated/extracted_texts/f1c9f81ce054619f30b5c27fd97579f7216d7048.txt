ing three aspects: (1) Uncertainty reduction using random erasing: To
make our model robust, we exploit an agreement from multiple im-
ages after erasing random small rectangular areas as a certainty. And
then, we correct the tracking state of our model accordingly. (2) Ran-

1 Introduction
Visual Object Tracking (VOT), the task of continuously locating an arbitrary
target in the first frame of a video, has been drawn attention in both aca-
demic and industrial fields over the last decade [28,16,18]. It is because VOT
can be widely used in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles [20],
robotics[29],andvideosurveillancesystems[1].Withtheadvanceofdeeplearn-
ing techniques, trackers are not only getting better performance but also used
at long-term tracking (minute-level) beyond short-term tracking (second-level).

Besides the length of input videos, the clear difference between short-term
trackingandlong-termtrackingiswhetherthetargetexistsinthefieldofview,as
reflectedinstandardbenchmarkdatasets[33,25].Ingeneral,short-termtrackers
are designed on the assumption that the target always appears in every single
frame, otherwise, the short-term tracker will drift and fail. Long-term trackers,
ontheotherhand,needtokeeptrackoftheobjectevenifitdisappearsfromthe
fieldofviewinthemiddleoftheframes.Consequently,there-detectionmodule,
which localizes the target with a confidence score of its absence, is the essential
part of long-term trackers.
Because long-term trackers encounter unpredictable abrupt changes during
relativelylongsequences,therobustnessisthemostimportantpropertyoflong-
term trackers. If the long-term tracker misestimates the location of a target
because of visual deformation, there is a high risk of incorrect estimation in
the following frame. Previous researches tried to construct robust modules and
strategiesinvariouswayssuchasP-Nlearning[15],memorymodel[21],anddy-
namic programming [30]. Those methods are focusing on the robustness against
visual deformation.
Inthiswork,wefocusontherobustnessagainstthere-detectionmoduleitself
(i.e. reliability of the tracker’s prediction) as well as against visual deformation.
First, we propose a way to reduce the uncertainty of our model and correct
thepredictionaccordingly.Theestimatedlocationofthetarget,whichisrobust
againstthebackgroundnoise,wouldnotbechangedevenifweremoveacertain
small area of the background. If the estimation is not robust then it would
be changed and not reliable even though the confidence score is high. In view
of these characteristics, our model estimates the location of the target from
multiple images with randomly erased the small rectangular area. Secondly, we
utilize spatio-temporal constraints to adjust the confidence score for robust re-
detection.Whenthetargetre-appearafterocclusionordisappear,thetime-space
gap should be related in physical. For instance, if the estimated location of the
target that re-appears in a short time is far from the last observation location,
wecansaythattheestimationisunreliable.Tooffsetthedistortionofbothtime
and space and to make a robust estimation as a result, we explicitly adjust the
confidence score by penalizing it. Finally, we perform background augmentation
for more discriminative feature learning in the online stage.
Section 2 provides a brief description of existing short- and long-term track-
ers. In Section 3, we explain the details about how our approach can handle the
robustness issues of long-term trackers. The experimental results with analysis
and the conclusion are in Section 4 and 5, respectively.

neuralnetwork(DCNN)basedstudieshavebeenconducted,suchasMDNet[26]
and FCNT [31], showing successful results in the VOT Challenge [17]. Among
DCNN-based studies, Siamese architecture [5,23,30,32,22] satisfies end-to-end
training capabilities while also showing high efficiency [16,18]. DiMP [6] and
PrDiMP [11], motivated from the idea of ATOM [9] that solved the limited
targetestimationproblemofthepreviousstudies,arealsoSiamesearchitecture-
based model that showed performance improvement in the VOT Challenge.
Most tracking models before ATOM [9] were only focused on the develop-
ment of powerful classifiers. The problem of accurate target state estimation
has been overlooked. To this end, ATOM architecture consists of dedicated tar-
getestimationandclassificationcomponents.Thistargetestimationcomponent
is trained to predict the overlap between the target object and an estimated
bounding box. High-level knowledge is incorporated into the target estimation
through extensive offline learning.
Siamese networks [5,23,30,32,22] have received much attention due to their
end-to-endtrainingcapabilitiesandhighefficiency.However,Siameseapproaches
arelimitedintheirinabilitytoincorporateinformationfromthebackgroundre-
gion or previous tracked frames into the model prediction. To deal with this
issue, DiMP [6] takes inspiration from the discriminative online learning proce-
dures [9,10,26]. DiMP tracking architecture consists of two branches: a target
classification branch for distinguishing the target from the background, and a
bounding box estimation branch for predicting an accurate target box. The tar-
getclassificationbranchisderivedfromtwomainprinciples:(i)adiscriminative
learninglosspromotingrobustnessinthelearnedtargetmodeland(ii)apower-
ful optimization strategy ensuring rapid convergence. Bounding box estimation
branch is utilized from the overlap maximization based architecture introduced
in ATOM [9].
Most tacking models rely on estimating a state-dependent confidence score,
but this value lacks a clear probabilistic interpretation, complicating its use.
Therefore, in PrDiMP [11], a probabilistic regression formulation is proposed,
and it is applied to track the target. PrDiMP network predicts the conditional
probability density of the target state given an input image. Their formulation
helpsthemodeltoberobustfrominaccurateannotationsandambiguitiesinthe
task.
2.2 Long-term object tracking
The target may disappear in the long-term tracking setting, so a re-detection
module is essential. In addition, a robust online update method capable of ac-
commodatingchangesinthevisualappearanceofthetargetdramaticallyaffects
performance. Therefore, we shortly introduce how long-term trackers overcome
significant problems.
The most representative long-term object tracker is TLD [15], which is di-
vided into tracking (T), learning (L), and detection (D). In the tracking part,
the tracker predicts the position of the target object based on the median-flow
4 Seokeon Choi, Junhyun Lee, Yunsung Lee and Alexander Hauptmann
tracker [14]. In the detection part, the detector judges the existence of the tar-
get in a cascade manner over the entire area of the image. Assuming that the
trackeranddetectorcanfail,thelearningmoduleestimateserrorsbasedonP-N
learning and trains the trackers and detectors more robustly.
Due to its good performance in both accuracy and speed, various object
trackers based on Siamese networks have been proposed. One of those meth-
ods, MMLT [21], is designed for long-term tracking to handle visual deforma-
tion and target disappearance. In the tracking step, to accommodate changes in
the visual appearance, the target position is estimated by the Siamese features
obtained from short-term and long-term memory stores inspired by Atkinson-
Shiffrin Memory Model (ASMM) [2]. In the re-detection step, the target is de-
tected in the entire image without the dependency of the previous position. In
particular, the coarse-to-fine strategy is adopted for improving speed.
Tracking by re-detection paradigm [3,4,12,22] has a long history, but re-
detection is challenging due to the existence of distractor objects that are very
similartothetemplateobject.SiamR-CNN[30],anadaptationofFasterR-CNN
[27] with a Siamese architecture, has two key methods. First, they introduced a
hardexampleminingprocedurewhichtrainsthere-detectorspecificallyfordiffi-
cultdistractors.Secondly,dynamicprogrammingisusedtoselectthebestobject
in the current time step based on the complete history of all target objects and
distractor object tracklets(short object tracks). While being resistant to tracker
drift and being able to immediately re-detect object after the disappearance,
Siam R-CNN is able to effectively perform long-term object tracking.
3 Proposed Method
3.1 Baseline Short-Term Tracker
We propose an improved Discriminative Model Prediction method for robust
long-term tracking based on a pre-trained short-term tracker. Our baseline pre-
trained short-term tracker is SuperDiMP 1 combining the bounding-box regres-
sorofPrDiMP[11]withthestandardDiMPclassifier[6]forbettertrainingand
inference.

we correct the flag of our model according to the agreement.
3.3 Random Search with Spatio-Temporal Constraints
Generalshort-termtrackerscanonlyfindthetargetifitisincludedinthesearch-
ing area. Accordingly, global re-detection capacity is required for robust long-
termtrackingtodealwithocclusionsandtargetdisappearances.Mostlong-term
trackers adopt the global sliding window method, as shown in Fig. 2. However,
this approach not only requires high computation costs, but is not robust. To
tackle this problem, we propose a robust random search method with spatio-
temporal constraints.

time to find objects in all areas.

stochastic point of view, it is possible to search the entire area within a few frames.
Random search. First, we create global searching templates with a predeter-
minedinterval.Next,weadaptivelydeterminethenumberofsearchesaccording
totheratiooftheimagesizetothetargetsize.Whenthetargetsizeisrelatively
large, we set the fewer number to search. Otherwise, we assign more numbers
to search when the target size is relatively small. Then, an object is detected
within a randomly selected searching area. As visualized in Fig. 3, it is possible
tosearchwholeregionswithinafewframesfromastochasticpointofview.This

we note that this na¨ıve re-detection scheme is not robust. Figure 4 shows the
examplesofsuddendetectionofothersimilarobjectsorbackgrounddistractors.
Once the target is missing, a new object can be re-detected immediately, even if
the new object is located far from the original target. However, the probability
of an object disappearing and suddenly appearing at a distant location is very
low. To prevent this sudden detection, we penalize a confidence score through
spatio-temporal constraints, which is expressed as follows:

In terms of a spatial constraint, the score is more penalized when the distance
between new and old positions is large. This distance penalty term prevents
the problem of abnormal detection at a long distance. Meanwhile, this distance
penaltyiscompensatedbythetimepenalty(i.e.atemporalconstraint),astime
passes by not finding the target. This is because, if the period during which the
objectcannotbefoundbecomeslonger,theobjectmaynewlyappearatalonger
distance.Thistemporalconstraintallowsobjectstobedetectedatrelativelyfar
locations. The revised re-detection module makes the tracker more robust.
3.4 Background Augmentation for More Discriminative Feature
Learning
In the short-term baseline tracker, we extract features and trains the model by
applying some transforms (blur, rotate, horizontal flip) in the searching area of
the target. To train a robust model against the background clutter, we try to
augment various backgrounds that are not included in the search area by com-
biningthetargetimagewithanotherbackground.Thisaugmentationskillmakes
the model capable of fully exploiting various background appearance informa-
tion.Figure5showsourdataaugmentationmethodsforenhanceddiscriminative
feature learning.
Learning at the first frame. The bounding box is given in the first frame,
which means that the target image is completely confident. Therefore, we train
the short-term tracker using new data augmentation and additionally store the
newly generated images in the memory system. This approach allows for im-
proved discriminative learning in the first frame.

Online learning. We also perform background augmentation during tracking
intheonlinestageassameasinthefirstframe.However,thisprocessisonlyused
when the reliability of the bounding box is high since the estimated bounding
box is not always confident. The background augmentation process is the same
as the first frame one, and the filter is trained if more demanding conditions are
met.Unlikeinthefirstframesettings,imageswithbackgroundaugmentationare
not stored in memory. This prevents the problem of including negative features
that cause drifting to other objects.
3.5 Confidence Score Assignment
The baseline short-term tracker classifies the state of object tracking into four
typesaccordingtothescoreandvariousconditions:normal,hardnegative,uncer-
tain,andnot found.Inthecaseofnormal andhard negative,theobjecttracking
result is reliable, so the confidence score is given as 1. In the case of uncertain,
it is difficult to determine whether it is an object or not, so the confidence score
is given as 0.5. Lastly, in the case of not found, it is predicted that there is no
object, so the confidence score is given as 0.

4.2 Quantitative Evaluation
Overall comparison with long-term trackers. We compare our proposed
method with the state-of-the-art methods in the VOT-LT2019 benchmark [18].
TheVOT-LT2019andVOT-LT2020benchmarksarebasedontheLTB50dataset
[24]. Both of competing methods and our method are re-detecting long-term
trackers (LT1). This term means that all of the trackers detect tracking failure,
and an explicit re-detection technique is implemented, unlike the pseudo long-
term tracker (LT0). The following taxonomy has been introduced explicitly in
[24].

mance than the top three trackers of the VOT-LT2019 benchmark. Notably,
we achieve the highest score in the tracking recall metric, which means that

thissection,wecompareourlong-termtrackerwithvariousshort-termtrackers,

PrDiMP18 and DiMP18 are methods using ResNet18 as a backbone. DiMP50-
VOT is another version designed to follow a reset protocol for the VOT-ST
benchmark. The rest of the PrDiMP- and DiMP-family all follow the no-reset
protocol, so these methods can be applied well in a long-term object tracking
environment.
Figure 6 shows the maximum F-score for each sequence on LTB50. All se-
quences are listed in order of the number of target disappearances. We can
observe that the baseline tracker SuperDiMP has better reasoning skills than
the individual methods of DiMP [6] and PrDiMP [11]. We emphasize that our
RLT-DiMP method outperforms the baseline tracker in almost all sequences.
Thisprovesthat ourmethod is more suitable forlong-term objecttracking, and
robust modeling via uncertainty reduction, robust random search, and back-
ground augmentation plays a significant role. This is analyzed in more detail
through ablation studies in the next section.

tobaseline,theF-scoreisimprovedby0.025,0.031,and0.018.Accordingly,these
results prove that our sub-algorithms enable our tracker to estimate the target
position more robustly. We note that our RLT-DiMP method outperforms the
F-score by 0.038 compared to the baseline tracker.
In the visual attribute analysis, the proposed method surpasses the baseline
tracker in all cases. Especially in situations with visual characteristics of full-
occlusion, aspect ratio change, fast motion, and partial occlusion, our method
has an F-score performance of 0.05 or higher than the baseline.
Processing time analysis. In the LTB50 dataset, our method records 14.17
fps, which is somewhat lower than the object tracking speed of PrDiMP [11]
at 21.83 fps and DiMP [6] at 30.22 fps. All three proposed modules inevitably

that the random search method can improve the speed of about 3 fps compared
to the global sliding window method.

4.4 Qualitative Evaluation
Inthissection,weperformqualitativeevaluationbyselectingseveralsequences,
which are visualized in Fig 8. The total of 10 selected sequences is sorted based
on the number of times the target disappeared. Besides, not only the number of

We show through various examples that our method RLT-DiMP estimates
a target position more accurately than SuperDiMP, PrDiMP [11], and DiMP
[6],withoutdependingontheabovesituations.Inparticular,weemphasizethat
our method has a robust re-detection ability with the aid of spatio-temporal
contraints in dog, bird1, boat, and person7 sequences where the target object
suddenly re-appears in a different location. In addition, we note that the target
is robustly tracked in carchase, warmup, uav1, and group2 sequences with sim-
ilar objects or background clutter through uncertainty reduction using random
erasing and enhanced discriminative feature learning with background augmen-
tation.

robustness for long-term tracking through uncertainty reduction using random
erasing,robustrandomsearchwithspatio-temporalconstraints,andbackground
augmentation for more discriminative feature learning. Quantitative and quali-
tative evaluation on the VOT-LT2020 benchmark dataset demonstrates the su-
periority of our method over the state-of-the-art long-term trackers.
