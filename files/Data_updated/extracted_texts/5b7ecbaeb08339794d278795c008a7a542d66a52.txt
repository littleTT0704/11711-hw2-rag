A discursive analysis of crisis response strategies in CEO apologies:
Drawing on linguistic insights from the appraisal framework
Abstract
When corporations are confronted with a crisis, well-crafted CEO apologies can serve to
repair, restore, and rebuild a damaged corporate image. In prior research, the use of linguistic
resources exhibited in CEO corporate apology discourse for different crisis response
strategies has not been sufficiently examined. Drawing on the appraisal framework and
subsumed linguistic resources, this study analyzed the discursive construction of crisis
response strategies in the corporate apology discourse of leading companies listed in the
Fortune Global 2000. The findings revealed an integrated use of crisis response strategies in
which attitude appraisal resources predominated, while different types of appraisal resources
were deployed in various crisis response strategies to achieve rhetorical persuasion in
corporate communication. The proposed framework integrating crisis response strategies in
CEO apology discourse with appraisal resources could guide CEOs and crisis communicators
to use the right words when composing corporate apologies.

Introduction
Corporations are increasingly exposed to unpredictable crises that can endanger their
reputation (Coombs, 2007). As corporate reputation is an invaluable asset (Barnett et al.,
2006; Coombs & Holladay, 2002), effective crisis responses from corporations are crucial in
maintaining, protecting, and defending reputation (Benoit, 1995), particularly when new and
social media allow crises to escalate rapidly (Austin & Jin, 2018).
When a corporation is involved in high levels of crisis responsibility, as in a preventable
crisis posing a huge reputational threat to the corporation, a well-composed corporate
apology could mitigate the negative effects of the crisis (Benoit, 2018; Coombs & Holladay,
2008; Hearit, 2006). In fact, many studies have shown that CEOs’ (Chief Executive Officers)
apologies could signal the corporation’s reparative behaviors and suggest greater
authoritative accountability (Turk et al., 2012). Arguably, the acceptance of an apology is
largely determined by the use of right words or strategically crafting the message through
various textual linguistic devices to achieve rhetorical persuasiveness. As messages
manifested in crisis response strategies can shape public perceptions of the crisis (Coombs,
1995), CEOs and public relations (PR) practitioners need to equip themselves with the right
words to compose convincing apologies for crisis management. However, little research has
examined how response strategies used in apologies are linguistically realized as previous
studies have mainly focused on the form and content of response strategies (Fediuk et al.,
2011). Drawing on the appraisal framework (Martin & White, 2005) that relies on textual
linguistic resources to negotiate evaluations and construct solidarity with the addressees, this
study proposes a framework that integrates crisis response strategies with evaluative appraisal
resources to achieve rhetorical persuasion. The framework provides conceptual tools for
analyzing and explaining how CEOs negotiate and restore trust through the apology
4
discourse. It also provides insights into which linguistic resources could be strategically
utilized in crafting effective apology statements for CEO crisis communication.
Conceptual Framework
Corporate apology discourse and image repair
When high-profile business crises (e.g., Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone battery
explosions) pose challenges to corporate reputation, apologies are often offered as part of the
crisis response (Ma & Zhan, 2016). This study conceptualizes corporate apologies as
discourse characterized by a corporation’s acceptance of responsibility for a crisis and request
for forgiveness, which are essential for repairing a corporation’s image after a crisis (Coombs
& Holladay, 2008).
Image Repair Theory (IRT) (Benoit, 1995; 2015) encompasses five response strategies
for repairing corporate image from a crisis. These are denial (denial or shifting of blame),
evading responsibility (provocation, defeasibility, accident, or good intentions), reducing
offensiveness (bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attacking the accuser,
or compensation), taking corrective action, and mortification. IRT has focused on image
repair discourse, yet it is unable to inform crisis managers about responding with appropriate
strategies to specific and predictable levels of crisis responsibility (Coombs, 2010). Thus, the
three crisis clusters (victim cluster, accidental cluster, and preventable cluster) outlined in the
Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) have emerged to assist crisis leaders in
responding with appropriate strategies, ranging from defensive strategies such as denial, to
the accommodative ones such as issuing an apology (Coombs, 2007; Coombs & Holladay,
2002).
Because apologies can minimize crisis-induced negative effects (Coombs & Holladay,
2002), especially when strong crisis responsibility is attributed to the corporation, scholars
5
have investigated the components of effective apologies (e.g., Bentley, 2018). This research
has considered the ethics of CEO apologies (Koehn & Goranova, 2018), the relationship
between the verbal content of CEO apologies and their acceptability (Pace et al., 2010), and
how CEOs’ emotions exhibited in apologies affect the sincerity of apologies (Ten Brinke &
Adams, 2015). In addition, prior research has found that admission of responsibility,
expression of remorse, and corrective action were the most useful strategies in CEO
apologies for repairing the damaged image in high-crisis responsibility situations (Ngai &
Jin, 2016; Benoit, 2018). Overall, these studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
deploying integrated strategies to earn forgiveness, though few have scrutinized how these
strategies were discursively constructed in CEO apologies.
Linguistic approach for analyzing apology discourse
Corporate apologies might rely on the use of specific words to show the public that the
corporation is sincere and committed, for words can change the perceptions of interlocutors
(Erickson et al.,1978). One strand of linguistic research identifies features of apologies as
speech acts for mitigating the damage stemming from the crisis (e.g., Shariati & Chamani,
2010) while another strand is concerned with the communicative styles exhibited in apologies
(e.g., Rundquist, 2007). A third strand regards an apology as face work (Goffman, 1978),
viewing it as a strategy to reestablish rapport with the public (Ogiermann, 2009). However,
these studies do not reveal how the stance-taker (i.e., the CEO) negotiates his/her stance
through linguistically demonstrating his/her evaluative attitudes towards the crisis. The
appraisal framework, focusing on the expression of attitudes and values as an interpersonal
semantic approach (Martin & White, 2005), may contribute to the understanding of
discursive construction of CEO messages.
The appraisal framework, emanating from Systemic Functional Linguistics (Halliday,
1994), comprises linguistic evaluative resources exhibited in discourse which negotiate one’s
6
stance via attitudinal and evaluative expressions (Martin & White, 2005). The framework
consists of three evaluative systems—attitude, engagement, and graduation—with each
system constituted by its own subsystems. Affect, judgment, and appreciation resources
constitute three subcategories of the attitude system. Affect encodes the emotional reactions
of the appraiser to behaviors, texts/processes, or phenomena with positive and negative
valence (Martin & White, 2005). Feelings such as contrition are tied to emotions, as reflected
in this apology: “We are so sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers.” Judgment
resources make positive or negative ethical evaluations of human behavior (Martin & White,
2005), as exhibited in: “We’ve seen the video showing one of our couriers carelessly and
improperly delivering a package the other day.” In this sentence, the expressions “carelessly”
and “improperly” indicate a negative judgment of the courier’s behavior. Appreciation
resources refer to aesthetic evaluations of objects, artifacts, and states of affairs. For example,
in the expression, “We subjected you to unacceptable delays,” the word “unacceptable”
denotes a negative reaction to the experience encountered.
The engagement system, consisting of the subcategories of monogloss and heterogloss,
is concerned with the voice(s) manifested in discourse (Martin & White, 2005). Monogloss
reflects the subjectivity of language users in providing bare assertions without “reference to
other voices” (p. 99), whereas heterogloss embodies the objectivity of language users that
allows for “dialogistic alternatives” (p. 100). For example, the verb “prove” in the statement,
“This has proven to be a good solution,” wards off potential disagreement. By contrast, the
word “know” in the expression, “We know we failed to deliver on this promise,” opens the
dialogic space of the text, suggesting the speaker’s attempt to share what the public expects
from the company: good quality service.
Graduation, entailing force and focus resources, is concerned with modulating the
degree of evaluation (Martin & White, 2005). Force relates to intensity (intensification) and
7
amount (quantification) of the assessment while focus refers to grading according to
prototypicality by which category boundaries are identified (Martin & White, 2005).
Sharpening resources, as manifested in boosters, and softening resources, such as hedges, can
be manipulated to strengthen or downgrade utterances. For example, utterances including
“truly regretful” or “extremely sorry” indicate expressed contrition with upscale/sharpening
features, whereas the expression “small likelihood of occurrence” suggests incidents with
downscale/softening features.
The appraisal framework can shed light on the discourse mechanisms underlying CEO
stance negotiations with stakeholders. For example, in this phrase, “we subjected you to
unacceptable delays, flight cancellations, lost baggage, and other major inconvenience,” the
CEO expresses deep concern for the appalling experiences encountered by customers by
relying on negative appreciation resources such as “unacceptable” and “inconvenience.” This
framework could potentially serve as a useful apparatus for the analysis of CEOs’ endeavors
to build interpersonal relationships with stakeholders.
In sum, the extant crisis communication research on CEO apologies has shown the
pivotal role of corporate apologies in handling crises, but it fails to uncover how the right
words can be used in apologies so that stakeholders will understand how sincere the
corporation is. This study fills this gap and seeks to reveal the strategic deployment of
linguistic resources in CEO crisis response strategies to restore trust. Therefore, the following
research questions are proposed:
RQ1: How are appraisal resources exhibited in crisis response strategies used in CEO
corporate apologies?
RQ2: How are the crisis response strategies discursively constructed by evaluative
appraisal resources in the corporate apologies?
8
Method
Using the sentence as a unit of analysis, this study adopted content analysis to examine
the use of evaluative appraisal resources in crisis response strategies (RQ1). To elaborate on
the discursive construction of crisis response strategies (RQ2), textual analysis of the use of
evaluative appraisal resources in these strategies was presented based on a framework
integrating crisis response strategies with their corresponding use of appraisal resources.
Sampling
We used a purposive sampling method to collect CEO apologies released from high
profile crisis management cases involving accidents brought on by humans (including out-of-
control employees), product recalls caused by human errors, and organizational misdeeds.
We conducted an online search of company websites, social media sites (i.e., Facebook,
blogs, Twitter, YouTube), and media reports from 2007 to 2018 from leading companies
listed in the Fortune Global 2000. The cases included in the sample attracted immense
attention, and thus were mentioned by PR practitioners on Twitter, blogs, or Facebook and/or
covered by prestigious or authoritative media, such as Fortune, Forbes, or New York Times.
Then, we collected initial CEO apologies, mostly released within one week after the crisis
had occurred. The first author and a native English speaker transcribed the apologies
verbatim if video apologies were employed. In total, we gathered 20 corporate apologies
covering a range of industries including banking, electronics, science and technology service,
aviation, auto, and retail. To determine whether the apologies facilitated the corporations’
crisis communication, we examined PR practitioners’ online comments on the
aforementioned media that provided highly positive comments regarding the apologies.
Further, academic research articles confirming the contributing role of the CEO apology in
handling the crisis were collected. Additionally, we checked the reputation institute rankings
of a corporation in the year when the crisis occurred to provide evidence of the company’s
9
effectiveness in managing the crisis. Table 1 shows the selected cases and length of the
apology, and Appendix 1 provides the links of selected apologies and information of their
contributive role in crisis management.

Coding scheme
Two coding schemes were developed based on the conceptual framework. To address
RQ1, we employed a two-stage coding exercise. As Benoit’s IRT (1995, 2015) offers the
most comprehensive image restoration framework and is widely adopted in crisis discourse
studies (e.g. Nekmat et al., 2014), we coded the presence of the crisis response strategies (i.e.
denial, evading responsibility, reducing offensiveness, taking corrective action, and
mortification) to reveal the CEOs’ use in apologies in the first stage. A total of 315 sentences
were collected from 20 corporate apologies. Only the dominant strategy used in each
sentence was coded. Table 2 illustrates the strategies and examples from the collected data,
and Appendix 2 provides illustrations of the coding of the dominant crisis response strategies.

In stage two, by drawing on the appraisal framework, we coded a typology of three
subsystems of attitude resources (affect, judgment, and appreciation) and their tonality
(positive and negative), one subsystem of engagement resources (heterogloss), and two
subsystems of graduation resources (force, focus) on a sentence basis. We excluded
monogloss in engagement resources because monogloss that rejects dialogue is inapplicable
given the interactive nature of apology discourse with the public.
To reveal the use of appraisal resources in different crisis response strategies, we
examined the lexical/phrasal verb indicators (Blum–Kulka & Levenston, 1987) of the
appraisal resources in each sentence. Table 3 illustrates the appraisal resources and the related
lexical/phrasal verb indicators in our data. It should be noted that sentences in the response
strategies not employing any appraisal resources were not included in our findings. Further,
we noticed that many sentences employed multiple lexical/phrasal verb indicators of various
appraisal resources categories and sub-categories. Therefore, double coding was allowed to
exhaustively code the use of appraisal resources in the subsystems. See Appendix 2 for the
illustration of double coding of the use of appraisal resources in CEO apologies.

Coding procedure and intercoder reliability
One coder, a full-time research assistant, was comprehensively trained to undertake half
of the content coding of the apologies. The first author completed the other half of the coding.
To ensure consistency in the interpretation of the coding scheme of response strategies and
appraisal resources, both coders coded eight corporate apologies (40% of the total number of
apologies studied) to check on intercoder reliability. All disagreements were discussed prior
to the comprehensive implementation of the coding exercise. For all categories, the average
pairwise percent of agreement was greater than 0.88, and the average pairwise Cohen’s
Kappa was greater than 0.8, indicating an almost perfect agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977;
Hallgren, 2012). See Appendix 3 for the summary of the IRR statistics of the coding items.
Findings and discussion
Regarding RQ1, our results were consistent with previous studies (e.g. Ngai & Jin, 2016;
Benoit, 2018; Holdener & Kauffman, 2014), indicating an integrated use of crisis response
strategies in 34% of sentences (106 out of 315) of the apologies. Table 4 summarizes the use
of appraisal resources in the sub-systems of the appraisal framework for the corresponding
crisis response strategies.
As seen in Table 4, attitude resources were the most preferred resource type. These
resources index the CEO’s evaluation of the crisis, the corporation’s involvement in the crisis
and its commitment to crisis rectification. Additionally, appreciation (e.g., first-class,
disruptive) predominantly occurred in strategies (except mortification) deploying attitude
15
resources. Furthermore, negative affect (e.g., sorry) resources were salient in the mortification
strategy, together with the use of the intensified force (e.g., very).

Informed by these results, we propose a new framework to integrate the strategies with
their corresponding use of dominant appraisal resources to address RQ2. As shown in Table

1) Emphasizing Remedial Effects
The ERE approach which was predominant in corporate apology discourse emphasizes
the company’s commitment to preventing the crisis from escalating and ensuring that similar
wrongdoings will not recur. It intends to rebuild a positive image of sincerity by expressing
sympathy, taking preventive measures, and providing compensation.
Corrective action, as the most preferred restorative strategy in apologies, focuses on
actions taken to repair the damaged image (Lazare, 2005). As suggested, expressions of
regret alongside a changed attitude or policy can add credibility to the request for forgiveness
(Koesten & Rowland, 2004). This strategy is discursively constructed by the predominant use
of positive appreciation, followed by positive judgment and graduation. See example 1 and 2
below.
(1) The company dramatically increased [positive Appreciation] the number of customer
service representatives at the call centers and the website has been improved [positive
Appreciation] to handle the large number of visitors. (Apology from Richard Smith, CEO of
Equifax, 2017)
In example 1, the positive appreciation resources “drastically increased” and “improved”
project the company’s confidence and competence to tackle the crisis and redress the
unfavorable situation. Moreover, these resources emphasize positive outcomes because of
corrective behavior.
(2) I am extremely [Graduation] sorry [negative Affect] and it is something we will never
[Heterogloss] forget and it is something we are utterly [Force] determined [positive
Judgment] will never be repeated. (Apology from Kevin Johnson, CEO of Starbucks, 2018)
19
As can be seen in example 2, the CEO conveys his regret and promise for a change as
instantiated in the expression of “determined will never be repeated,” whereby actions
adopted by the company are probably viewed positively by the public and help rebuild the
image of the company. The repeated emphasis on the positive influence brought by the
company’s actions facilitates the repair of the tarnished image and elicits forgiveness
(Worthington, 2006).
Mortification strategies include a predominant use of negative affect resources. As a
function of the “emotional framing of persuasive appeals,” affect (also termed as “pathos” in
Aristotle’s rhetorical triangle) could contribute to persuasiveness (DeSteno et al., 2004, p.
43). As suggested by Coombs and Holladay (2005), strong feelings of sympathy could assist
an organization in engendering potential supportive behavior from stakeholders. Consider the
following example 3.
(3) That begins with my sincere apologies [negative Affect] to everyone who has been
affected by this recall…especially to the families and friends of those who lost their
lives or were injured. I am deeply [Force] sorry [negative Affect]. (Apology from Mary
Barra, CEO of General Motors, 2014)
In Example 3, GM’s CEO expresses contrition for the defective ignition switch problem
through negative affect “apologies” and “sorry” with the boosted force “deeply.” Negative
affect resources present the CEO as a caring person who seeks forgiveness due to
misconduct. Furthermore, the prevailing use of intensifiers in expressing sincere remorse is
effective because the tone of voice reflects sincerity in interpersonal communication (Afifi,
2007). Empathy and remorse help build solidarity with the public through which a deeper
level of bonding can be achieved. Because a close personal relationship can contribute to
repairing a damaged relationship (Lewis et al., 2015), the apology is viewed as more
acceptable when relational outcomes are nurtured.
20
2) Maximizing Positive Effects
Strategies to reduce offensiveness—like bolstering—were more employed in the MPE
approach, aiming at emphasizing the company’s good image of prior self (Kiambi & Shafer,
2016). This strategy can be linguistically realized using positive appreciation, engagement,
and positive judgment. Consider example 4 below.
(4) The hard work [positive Judgment] of regaining the trust [positive Appreciation] of
the American people that was developed over the course of the company’s 118 year
history is ongoing and I know [Heterogloss] it must [Heterogloss] be sustained.
(Apology from Richard Smith, CEO of Equifax, 2017)
In example 4, the CEO, drawing on the positive appreciation “trust” and positive
judgment “hard work,” boasts about the company’s long-term diligence and willingness to
rectify the misdeed. In addition, the CEO employs the engagement “know” to seek common
ground with the public and indicate that the company shares the public’s expectations of an
excellent service standard while he uses “must” to emphasize his work commitment.
3) Neutralizing Negative Effects
In this approach, evading responsibility strategies (i.e., defeasibility) ascribe the crisis
situation to some external factors beyond the company’s control, which can be realized
through negative appreciation as illustrated by example 5.
(5) I wish we could have gotten the answers we needed sooner, but [Heterogloss] forensic
analysis is a very [Force] complex [negative Appreciation], time-consuming [negative
Appreciation] process. (Apology from Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony, 2011)
21
To neutralize the bad consequences induced by the crisis, the CEO uses the heterogloss
“but” alongside the negative appreciation “complex” and “time-consuming,” with the
boosted force “very” to justify the failure to provide timely customer service.
The strategy of accident—which occurred infrequently—can be discursively constructed
by manipulating positive and negative appreciation, as illustrated in example 6.
(6) This matter is an unfortunate [negative Appreciation] exception to the outstanding
[positive Appreciation] service FedEx team members deliver every single day. (Apology
from Matthew Thornton III, Senior Vice President of US Operations FedEx Express,
2011)
When communicating the message that the courier’s delivery behavior is a rare case, the
Senior VP of FedEx uses the negative appreciation “unfortunate” to express his regret for the
incident while using positive appreciation “outstanding” to stress the shared evaluation of the
company’s service commitment to the public.
Simple denial rarely occurred in corporate apology discourse as it generates an
unfavorable impression of corporations regarding avoiding responsibility if used improperly.
Denial can be constructed via the use of engagement, as shown in example 7 below.
(7) Based on what we know [Heterogloss] now, there is no [Heterogloss] evidence that
banking, credit card, medical information (such as claims, test results, or diagnostic codes)
were targeted or compromised. (Apology from Joseph R. Swedish, CEO of Anthem Blue
Cross, 2015)
The CEO uses the heterogloss “know” to signal the shared expectations with
stakeholders that the investigation has been conducted, and the use of “no” indicates that the
crisis was not as severe as had been previously perceived.

Conclusion, Implications, and Limitations
As one of the first attempts to examine corporate leaders’ crisis communication through
the lens of the appraisal framework, this study’s findings advance our understanding of what
makes CEO apologies more acceptable with respect to the use of appropriate words or
linguistic devices for different crisis responses. Crisis leaders can be made more
knowledgeable of which linguistic resources to draw on to compose convincing apologies for
crisis management. For example, CEOs can utilize positive appreciation in attitude resources
to reduce hostility and rebuild corporate image, and negative appreciation to elicit empathy
and neutralize negative effects induced by the crisis.
Another noteworthy contribution of this research is that by categorizing all CEO crisis
response strategies into three approaches to reflect their distinct communicative goals—
namely Emphasizing Remedial Effects, Maximizing Positive Effects, and Neutralizing
Negative Effects—we have illustrated when and how evaluative appraisal resources can be
linguistically deployed to compose apologies for different crisis response strategies. Finally,
this study has added a new perspective to research on corporate apologies by proposing an
integrated model of the IRT and appraisal framework. This model offers insights into how
preferred crisis response strategies are manifested through linguistic devices to enhance the
acceptability of apologies and achieve the goal of repairing relationships with the public.
Regarding practical implications, the findings provide value to crisis leaders, PR practitioners
and corporate communicators, and have pedagogical implications for instructors of PR
writing courses on how to compose well-written apologies through the strategic use of
evaluative appraisal resources.
In terms of limitations, the small size of the corpus and use of purposive sampling limit
the generalizability of the results. The proposed framework also requires further testing via
empirical research through the use of experiments and interviews to investigate the public’s
23
perceptions of the effectiveness of appraisal resources in apologies. Undertaking research on
the effectiveness of handling crises in a timely manner on social media would lend additional
focus to how instant CEO messages to crises are received.
