ABSTRACT: A high-throughput screen based on a viral replication
assay was used to identify inhibitors of the human cytomegalovirus.

Preliminary structure−activity relationships demonstrated that the
potency of compound 1 could be improved to a low nanomolar level,
but metabolic stability was a key optimization parameter for this series.
AstrategyfocusedonminimizingmetabolichydrolysisoftheN1-amide
led to an alternative scaffold in this series with improved metabolic
stability and good pharmacokinetic parameters in rat.

two key findings from this effort are summarized in Table 2.
First, it was found that the N1 position showed very steep

membered heterocycles were tolerated as replacements for the

the 4-thiazolyl group generally providing the most active
compounds (cf. compounds 2−5). Second, the N4 position
was shown to be very permissive to structural changes and we
were quickly able to improve antiviral potency to the
submicromolar range through introduction of more lipophilic
substituents (cf. compounds 1 and 6−9 or compounds 2 and
10). Another early observation was that the poor metabolic aHalf maximal effect concentration measured by cytopathic effect for

cross-linking experiments was unsuccessful, and so it remains
unknown if the target of these compounds is glycoprotein B,
another viral protein or a host cell protein.
The compounds featured in Table 2 all have an embedded
1,4-diaminobenzene core capped on each nitrogen atom with
an acyl group. If either of these amides were subject to
hydrolysis in vivo, the resulting electron rich aniline could
potentiallybesubjecttobioactivation,whichinturncouldpose
a risk of genotoxicity.10 In view of this consideration, HLM-
metabolite identification experiments were conducted to
establish if either amide bond was generally predisposed to
metabolic hydrolysis. The results clearly indicated that the N1
amide bond was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding aniline.

wide variety of aliphatic replacements for the central aromatic
core were also screened, but in all cases explored, a complete
loss of antiviral potency was observed.
FacedwiththerealitythattheN-arylamidecoreofthisseries

of the N1 amide were established empirically using the HLM
assay. In short, the metabolic stability for a wide range of
compounds was compared in the presence and absence of the
cytochrome P450 cofactor NADPH (a full description can be
found in the Supporting Information). Compounds were
grouped based on the dependence of metabolic stability on
the presence of NADPH in the assay conditions. Structural
features common to the compounds that depended on
NADPH for metabolic clearance were then prioritized for
future optimization. From this analysis, two general trends
emerged.First,thenatureofthefive-memberedheteroaromatic

compounds 1 and 3, respectively, were completely resistant to
hydrolysis, while both the thiazole and thiadiazole found in
compounds 2 or 4, respectively, were particularly prone to
hydrolysis. Unfortunately, aligning potency with ADME
properties favorably for the furan or oxazole containing
compounds was not possible, and so a path forward based on
modificationofthisringwasnotfeasible.Second,thenatureof
